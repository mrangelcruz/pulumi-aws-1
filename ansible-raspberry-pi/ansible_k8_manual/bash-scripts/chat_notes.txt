If your Kubernetes control plane (controller) node's IP changes, the worker nodes will lose their connection because they rely on the control plane's advertised address. Here's what you need to do to fix it:

✅ 1. Check what changed

If you are using a hostname/DNS name instead of an IP in your kubeadm config and kubelet configs, then you just need to update DNS to point to the new IP.

If you are using a raw IP address (most common), you need to update the configurations on both the control plane and the workers.

✅ 2. On the Control Plane Node

Update the API server's advertise address:

sudo vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml


Look for:

--advertise-address=<old-IP>


Change it to the new IP and save.
The kubelet will automatically restart the static pod.

Verify:

kubectl get nodes


If the API server comes up correctly, you should see the control plane node ready.

✅ 3. Update the kubeconfig files

Your workers (and kubectl clients) use kubeconfig files that point to the old IP of the API server.

Control plane kubeconfigs:

sudo sed -i 's/<old-IP>/<new-IP>/g' /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
sudo sed -i 's/<old-IP>/<new-IP>/g' /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
sudo sed -i 's/<old-IP>/<new-IP>/g' /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
sudo sed -i 's/<old-IP>/<new-IP>/g' /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf


Restart components:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet

✅ 4. On Each Worker Node

The workers have their kubelet pointing to the old API server IP in:

/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf


and also in the bootstrap kubeconfig:

/etc/kubernetes/bootstrap-kubelet.conf


Update:

sudo sed -i 's/<old-IP>/<new-IP>/g' /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
sudo sed -i 's/<old-IP>/<new-IP>/g' /etc/kubernetes/bootstrap-kubelet.conf


Restart kubelet:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet

✅ 5. If kubelet fails to reconnect

If the workers still fail to register:

Rejoin them using the kubeadm join command with the new IP:

kubeadm token create --print-join-command


Then run that on each worker node.

✅ Better Practice for Next Time

Use a DNS name (like k8s-api.example.com) instead of a raw IP.

Point the DNS record to the controller IP.

Or use a Load Balancer / Virtual IP (e.g., keepalived + haproxy) for HA control plane.

👉 Do you want a one-liner script to automatically update all references of the old IP to the new IP on both control plane and workers? Or do you want instructions for making the API server reachable by DNS name instead of IP so this never happens again?

After revising file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml to new IP, I invoked:
kubectl get nodes

Result:
E0902 19:20:05.529926    5210 memcache.go:265] "Unhandled Error" err="couldn't get current server API group list: Get \"https://192.168.1.98:6443/api?timeout=32s\": dial tcp 192.168.1.98:6443: connect: connection refused"
ChatGPT said:

That error means the kube-apiserver is not running or not reachable on the new IP. This typically happens when the static pod didn’t come up correctly after editing /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml.

✅ Why this happens

If the new IP you set in --advertise-address is not assigned to any interface, the API server fails to bind.

If you only changed --advertise-address but not --bind-address or the certificate SANs, the API server might start but fail TLS verification.

kube-apiserver pods are managed as static pods by kubelet. If the manifest is invalid or the IP is wrong, kubelet will not start it.

✅ Step 1: Check kube-apiserver pod status

Run on the control plane node:

crictl ps -a | grep kube-apiserver


or

docker ps -a | grep kube-apiserver    # if using Docker


If it’s in CrashLoopBackOff, check logs:

crictl logs <container-id>

✅ Step 2: Validate the new IP

Make sure the new IP is actually assigned to the control plane network interface:

ip addr show

✅ Step 3: Check for common mistakes

Did you only update --advertise-address?
You don’t need to touch --advertise-address for connectivity; it’s just what kubeadm uses to tell others. The API server listens by default on --bind-address=0.0.0.0 unless you changed it.

What you really need to update for clients (like kubectl) to connect is the kubeconfig server entry, not --advertise-address.

✅ What to do now

Restore original kube-apiserver.yaml from backup or copy:

cp /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml.bak /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml


(or manually fix the IP back to the working one if possible)

Restart kubelet to re-pull the static pod:

systemctl restart kubelet


Wait for API server pod to be Running:

crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver

✅ Correct procedure for IP change

If the node’s IP changed, you don’t need to change --advertise-address unless you have multiple interfaces and want to pick one.
Instead:

Update kubeconfig files:

sed -i 's/old-IP/new-IP/g' /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
sed -i 's/old-IP/new-IP/g' /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
sed -i 's/old-IP/new-IP/g' /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
sed -i 's/old-IP/new-IP/g' /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf


Then update the same on workers in /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.

✅ Quick question:

Do you want to recover your current cluster without rejoining nodes (just update configs), or is it OK to reset and rejoin workers after fixing the control plane?
If you want to recover without rejoin, I’ll give you the exact steps for updating certs and kubeconfigs to the new IP.

ChatGPT said:

Great, this confirms the kube-apiserver container exited, so it failed to start after your manifest change.

✅ Next Step: Check the logs for the reason it failed

Run:

sudo crictl logs 635f2b8cc1568


(or the container ID you see in your output)

Common errors you might see:

Failed to bind to address → The new IP does not exist on any interface.

Certificate SAN mismatch → The new IP is not in the kube-apiserver certificate.

Wrong manifest syntax → YAML formatting issue after edit.

✅ While checking logs, here are likely causes and fixes:
1. IP not assigned to interface

Run:

ip addr show


Ensure the new IP is present.

2. Certificates do not include the new IP

The API server uses certificates stored in:

/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt


If your new IP is not listed in the Subject Alternative Names (SANs), the API server may fail TLS checks.

Check SANs:

openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt -text | grep -A1 "Subject Alternative Name"


If the new IP is missing:

Regenerate certs with:

kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --apiserver-advertise-address <new-IP> --control-plane-endpoint <new-IP>:6443


Then restart kubelet:

systemctl restart kubelet

3. Manifest misconfiguration

If you edited /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml, check:

No extra spaces or tabs.

Correct argument format:

- --advertise-address=<new-IP>

✅ If you just want to recover quickly:

Simplest way: Revert /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml to its original state.

If you don't have a backup, replace the wrong IP with the correct old IP.

Then restart kubelet:

systemctl restart kubelet


Verify API server pod:

crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver


Do you want me to:
✔ Give you the exact commands to regenerate the API server certs and kubeconfigs for the new IP
or
✔ Show how to revert and fix without regenerating anything (fast recovery)?

Your logs show this:

grpc: addrConn.createTransport failed to connect to {Addr: "127.0.0.1:2379"} ... dial tcp 127.0.0.1:2379: connect: connection refused


This means kube-apiserver cannot connect to etcd on 127.0.0.1:2379.
So the real problem now is etcd is not running (or failed to start after your IP change).

✅ Why is etcd failing?

etcd in a single-control-plane cluster usually runs as a static pod in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml.

If you changed the controller’s IP in that file or certificates, etcd might fail because:

The advertise-client-urls or listen-peer-urls reference the old IP.

The etcd certificates are bound to the old IP.

✅ Check etcd container

Run:

sudo crictl ps -a | grep etcd


If it’s not running, get logs:

sudo crictl logs <etcd-container-id>

✅ Quick fix approach:

If you only changed the kube-apiserver manifest but not etcd.yaml, etcd should still be running. If it's not, it means the IP change broke etcd too.

Check /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml for:

--advertise-client-urls=https://<old-IP>:2379
--listen-client-urls=https://<old-IP>:2379,https://127.0.0.1:2379
--initial-advertise-peer-urls=https://<old-IP>:2380
--listen-peer-urls=https://<old-IP>:2380


If <old-IP> is still there, update it to your new IP.

✅ After fixing etcd manifest:

Save changes.

kubelet will automatically restart the static pod.

Verify:

sudo crictl ps | grep etcd


Once etcd is running, kube-apiserver should start normally.

✅ If etcd certs are tied to old IP:

Run:

openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt -text | grep "IP Address"


If the new IP is missing, regenerate etcd certs:

kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server --config=/etc/kubernetes/kubeadm.conf


(or use the IP directly with --apiserver-advertise-address)

Your current error is 100% because etcd is down.
Do you want me to give you:
✔ Exact steps to fix etcd manifest and regenerate its certs for new IP (safe recovery)
or
✔ Shortcut hack to restore old IP temporarily so everything comes back up quickly?

ChatGPT said:

So etcd is also failing, which explains why kube-apiserver can’t connect. The cluster won’t work until etcd is up.

✅ Next: Check why etcd failed

Run:

sudo crictl logs 7a82ad8bf142b


Typical errors you might see:

failed to bind to address → etcd is trying to use old IP that no longer exists.

certificate SAN mismatch → The certs only include the old IP.

✅ Quick fix depends on the log result, but here’s what likely happened:

Your /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml still references the old IP in these flags:

--advertise-client-urls
--listen-client-urls
--listen-peer-urls
--initial-advertise-peer-urls


Example (broken):

--advertise-client-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2379
--listen-client-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2379,https://127.0.0.1:2379


When the node IP changed, etcd couldn’t bind to 192.168.1.98.

✅ To fix:

Edit the manifest:

sudo vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml


Update every occurrence of old-IP to new-IP.

Save and exit.
Kubelet will restart the etcd static pod automatically.

Check etcd pod status:

sudo crictl ps | grep etcd


If etcd starts running, kube-apiserver will follow.

⚠ If logs show cert errors:

Run:

openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt -text | grep "IP Address"


If new IP is missing, regenerate etcd certs:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server --apiserver-advertise-address <new-IP>
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer --apiserver-advertise-address <new-IP>
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client --apiserver-advertise-address <new-IP>


Then restart:

systemctl restart kubelet


✅ Your situation now:

Both etcd and kube-apiserver are down because of the IP change.

Fix order:

Fix etcd.yaml → etcd running.

Fix certs if needed → regenerate.

Kube-apiserver will then start.

Do you want me to give you the exact corrected etcd.yaml configuration with placeholders for your new IP, so you can copy-paste it? Or should I give you a full script to update etcd + apiserver manifests and regenerate certs automatically?

Thought for 20s

Thanks—those logs are super clear:

creating peer listener failed ... listen tcp 192.168.1.99:2380: bind: cannot assign requested address

etcd is trying to bind to 192.168.1.99, but that IP is no longer on the node. Fix etcd first; the API server will come up after.

Here’s a tight, proven sequence you can run on the control-plane node.

1) Get the node’s actual new IP

(Or just substitute the correct one you know.)

ip -4 addr show
# pick the IP on the interface you expect (e.g., enp0s3/eth0)
# assume it’s: NEWIP=192.168.1.100   <--- replace with yours

2) Fix /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml

Replace every occurrence of the old IP (192.168.1.99 in your logs) with your NEWIP:

Flags you must update:

--advertise-client-urls=https://<NEWIP>:2379

--listen-client-urls=https://127.0.0.1:2379,https://<NEWIP>:2379

--initial-advertise-peer-urls=https://<NEWIP>:2380

--listen-peer-urls=https://<NEWIP>:2380

In --initial-cluster=... make sure the URL uses <NEWIP>:2380

Quick one-liner (change both OLD and NEW):

sudo sed -i 's/192\.168\.1\.99/192.168.1.100/g' /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml


Kubelet will auto-recreate the etcd static pod within a few seconds.

Verify:

sudo crictl ps | grep etcd
# should show etcd in Running


If it’s still Exited, show logs again:

sudo crictl logs $(sudo crictl ps -a --name etcd -q | head -n1)

3) Make sure the etcd certs include the NEWIP (likely needed)

Check SANs:

openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt -text -noout | grep -A1 "Subject Alternative Name"


If the NEWIP is missing, regenerate the etcd certs (safe with kubeadm):

# etcd server + peer + healthcheck client + apiserver's etcd client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client

# bounce kubelet so the static pods pick up the new certs
sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Re-check etcd:

sudo crictl ps | grep etcd

4) Fix the API server cert to include the NEWIP

Even with etcd up, the apiserver may fail TLS if clients connect to https://<NEWIP>:6443 and the certificate doesn’t list the NEWIP.

Regenerate the apiserver cert with the NEWIP as a SAN:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver \
  --apiserver-advertise-address 192.168.1.100 \
  --apiserver-cert-extra-sans 192.168.1.100

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Watch the apiserver come up:

sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver

5) Point kubeconfigs to the NEWIP

Update server endpoints in kubeconfigs on the control plane:

sudo sed -i 's/192\.168\.1\.99/192.168.1.100/g' /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
sudo sed -i 's/192\.168\.1\.99/192.168.1.100/g' /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
sudo sed -i 's/192\.168\.1\.99/192.168.1.100/g' /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
sudo sed -i 's/192\.168\.1\.99/192.168.1.100/g' /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf


Use the updated admin.conf for kubectl (or export KUBECONFIG):

export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
kubectl get --raw=/healthz
kubectl get nodes

6) Fix workers (brief)

Each worker’s kubelet must point to the NEWIP:

# run on each worker
sudo sed -i 's/192\.168\.1\.99/192.168.1.100/g' /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
sudo systemctl restart kubelet


If a worker still won’t register (e.g., certificates expired/mismatch), rejoin it:

# on control plane
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
# run printed command on the worker(s)

Tips to avoid this next time

Use a DNS name (e.g., k8s-api.mydomain.local) in kubeconfigs/certs and point DNS to the controller’s IP.

Or front the apiserver with a stable virtual IP / load balancer (keepalived + haproxy).

If you paste the actual NEWIP, I can give you the exact sed lines and a quick check list tailored to that address.

You said:
I have update /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml, but this line still has the old ip:

kubeadm.kubernetes.io/etcd.advertise-client-urls: https://192.168.1.99:2379

Do I change that as well?
ChatGPT said:

Yes. That annotation is part of the Pod metadata in the static pod manifest for etcd. It looks like this in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml:

metadata:
  annotations:
    kubeadm.kubernetes.io/etcd.advertise-client-urls: https://192.168.1.99:2379

✅ Should you change it?

Yes, update it to the new IP.

kubelet uses that manifest to run etcd, so keeping the old IP there is misleading and may break things like etcd health checks that kubeadm uses.

Change it to:

kubeadm.kubernetes.io/etcd.advertise-client-urls: https://<NEW-IP>:2379

✅ Why is it safe?

This annotation isn’t just cosmetic — kubeadm may use it when performing upgrades or health checks.

It does not regenerate automatically, so you must update it manually when the control-plane IP changes.

✅ After you update:

Save the file. Kubelet will restart the etcd static pod.

Check status:

sudo crictl ps | grep etcd


Do you want me to give you a full sed command to update:

all flags (--advertise-client-urls, --listen-*, --initial-*)

and the annotation
in a single step?

ChatGPT said:

Your output got cut off, but I’m assuming either nothing was listed or etcd is still in Exited state.

That means after updating /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml and the annotation, etcd still didn’t start.

✅ What to check now

Run:

sudo crictl ps -a | grep etcd


If it’s Exited, check logs again:

sudo crictl logs $(sudo crictl ps -a --name etcd -q | head -n1)


Most likely reasons why it’s still failing:

One of the IP flags in etcd.yaml wasn’t updated (there are 4 key flags).

The annotation was updated, but kubelet only cares about command-line flags for binding.

The new IP isn’t actually on any network interface (double-check with ip addr).

Certificates do not include the new IP (still likely).

✅ Quick verification steps

Confirm the new IP:

ip -4 addr show


Show all occurrences of the old IP in etcd manifest:

grep -n "192.168.1.99" /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml


Every line shown must be changed to the new IP.

If after fixing etcd.yaml it still fails with the same bind error, then the IP is wrong or missing from the interface.
If it fails with certificate SAN error, we need to regenerate etcd certs.

Do you want me to give you:

✔ The exact sed command that fixes all occurrences of the old IP in etcd.yaml including the annotation in one go,
and
✔ Commands to regenerate etcd certificates so they match the new IP (so you don’t get SAN issues)?

ChatGPT said:

Thanks for confirming: etcd is still in Exited state, even after your edits. This means it’s failing to bind or failing on certificate validation. The only way to know for sure is to check its logs again.

✅ Step 1: Show logs of the failing etcd pod

Run:

sudo crictl logs 770124a36d462


Look for:

bind: cannot assign requested address → still using old IP somewhere or IP missing on the interface.

certificate signed by unknown authority or certificate does not contain SAN → cert issue.

Any other config error.

✅ Step 2: Confirm all references to old IP are gone

Run:

grep -n "192.168.1.99" /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml


If this still outputs lines, etcd.yaml was not fully updated. You need to replace all occurrences.

To do it in one command:

sudo sed -i 's/192\.168\.1\.99/192.168.1.100/g' /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml


(Replace 192.168.1.100 with your actual new IP.)

✅ Step 3: Verify the new IP exists on the node

Run:

ip -4 addr show


Does the interface have 192.168.1.100?
If not, etcd cannot bind to it. You either:

Assign that IP to the interface (ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0), or

Use the current IP shown by ip addr.

✅ Step 4: If the logs show cert issues, regenerate certs

If the error is about SAN mismatch, do:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client
sudo systemctl restart kubelet


✅ Your next move:
Paste the output of:

sudo crictl logs 770124a36d462


so I can confirm whether the failure is IP binding or certificate issue.

Do you want me to also give you a full repair script that:
✔ Updates etcd.yaml and apiserver.yaml,
✔ Regenerates certs with the new IP,
✔ Updates kubeconfigs?
This would make the process one command instead of manual edits.

Thought for 5s

The logs show etcd is still trying to bind to 192.168.1.99:

listen tcp 192.168.1.99:2380: bind: cannot assign requested address


That means some references to the old IP remain in your static manifest(s) or etcd certs, so etcd keeps failing. Below are safe, concrete steps (commands you can copy/paste) to find & fix every remaining reference, regenerate certs, and bring etcd ↑ — plus a temporary quick-recovery “bind old IP to loopback” trick if you need immediate recovery.

Important: run these on the control-plane node.

1) Determine the node’s actual IP (automatic)

If you already know the new IP, skip this and set NEWIP to that value. Otherwise run:

# detect a likely non-loopback IPv4 and set NEWIP
NEWIP=$(ip -4 addr show scope global | awk '/inet / {split($2,a,"/"); print a[1]; exit}')
echo "Detected NEWIP=$NEWIP"


If NEWIP is empty or wrong, use the interface command to inspect and pick the correct IP:

ip -4 addr show

2) Replace every leftover occurrence of the old IP in the etcd manifest (and annotation)

Replace 192.168.1.99 with $NEWIP everywhere in the etcd manifest in one step:

sudo sed -i "s/192\.168\.1\.99/${NEWIP}/g" /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml


Verify no occurrences remain:

grep -n "192.168.1.99" /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml || echo "No occurrences left in etcd.yaml"


Also check the apiserver manifest (it may contain etcd client URL annotations too):

grep -n "192.168.1.99" /etc/kubernetes/manifests/* || true


If any other manifests still contain the old IP, update them similarly.

3) Confirm the NEWIP exists on an interface

If etcd still fails to bind after editing manifests, it may be because that IP isn't on the node:

ip -4 addr show | grep -w "${NEWIP}" || echo "NEWIP ${NEWIP} not present on any interface"


If it's not present and you want a quick temporary fix (use carefully), you can add the old IP back to loopback so etcd can bind immediately:

# TEMPORARY - only if you need immediate recovery; remove later with `ip addr del`
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.99/32 dev lo


This lets the static pods bind to the old IP while you finish fixing certs/config. Remember to remove it later:

sudo ip addr del 192.168.1.99/32 dev lo

4) Regenerate etcd certificates (if SAN is missing)

Check whether the etcd server cert contains the NEWIP:

openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt -text -noout | sed -n '/Subject Alternative Name/,$p'


If $NEWIP is not listed under IP Address:, regenerate the etcd certs and the apiserver-etcd-client cert. Using kubeadm phases:

# regenerate etcd certs
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client
# cert for apiserver -> etcd client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client


After regenerating certs, restart kubelet so static pods pick them up:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet

5) Regenerate apiserver cert (so kubeconfigs / clients work)

Make sure the apiserver cert includes the new IP as SAN:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --apiserver-advertise-address "${NEWIP}" --apiserver-cert-extra-sans "${NEWIP}"
sudo systemctl restart kubelet

6) Update kubeconfigs to point to NEWIP

Update control-plane kubeconfigs:

sudo sed -i "s/192\.168\.1\.99/${NEWIP}/g" /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
sudo sed -i "s/192\.168\.1\.99/${NEWIP}/g" /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
sudo sed -i "s/192\.168\.1\.99/${NEWIP}/g" /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
sudo sed -i "s/192\.168\.1\.99/${NEWIP}/g" /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf


Set KUBECONFIG and test API health:

export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
kubectl get --raw=/healthz
kubectl get nodes

7) Check etcd and kube-apiserver status & logs

Watch the containers:

sudo crictl ps -a | egrep 'etcd|kube-apiserver'


If etcd still Exited — get its logs (replace the ID if different):

ETCD_ID=$(sudo crictl ps -a --name etcd -q | head -n1)
sudo crictl logs $ETCD_ID


If kube-apiserver has problems, check its logs similarly:

APIS_ID=$(sudo crictl ps -a --name kube-apiserver -q | head -n1)
sudo crictl logs $APIS_ID

8) Update worker nodes

Once the control-plane (etcd + apiserver) is healthy, update each worker's kubelet kubeconfig to use the NEWIP:

# run on each worker
sudo sed -i "s/192\.168\.1\.99/${NEWIP}/g" /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
sudo systemctl restart kubelet


If a worker still fails to register, re-run the join command from the control-plane:

# on control-plane:
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
# then run the printed command on the worker

9) Cleanup (if you used the temporary loopback trick)

If you added the old IP to loopback, remove it once everything is stable:

sudo ip addr del 192.168.1.99/32 dev lo

Quick recovery summary (commands in order)

Detect IP:

NEWIP=$(ip -4 addr show scope global | awk '/inet / {split($2,a,"/"); print a[1]; exit}')
echo NEWIP=$NEWIP


Replace in etcd manifest:

sudo sed -i "s/192\.168\.1\.99/${NEWIP}/g" /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml


(Optional emergency) bind old IP to loopback:

sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.99/32 dev lo


Regenerate etcd & apiserver certs and restart kubelet:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --apiserver-advertise-address "${NEWIP}" --apiserver-cert-extra-sans "${NEWIP}"
sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Verify etcd and apiserver are running:

sudo crictl ps | egrep 'etcd|kube-apiserver'


Update kubeconfigs and workers (see step 6 & 8).

If you want, paste the output of:

ip -4 addr show

grep -n "192.168.1.99" /etc/kubernetes/manifests/*

sudo crictl ps -a | egrep 'etcd|kube-apiserver'

and I will point exactly which files still contain the old IP and give you the single-copy-paste commands to fix them.

You said:

It still shows the old ip?
ChatGPT said:

Exactly — that output confirms the problem: the etcd server certificate still contains the old IP (192.168.1.99) in its SAN. That’s why etcd is failing to start even if you updated /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml — it cannot bind securely with TLS to a new IP that isn’t in its certificate.

You must regenerate the etcd certificates to include the new IP. Here’s the correct way using kubeadm:

1) Set the new IP
NEWIP=<your-new-IP>   # replace with the actual new control-plane IP

2) Regenerate etcd certs
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client


This will recreate the certificates so that etcd can bind to the new IP with TLS.

3) Regenerate apiserver cert with new IP
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver \
  --apiserver-advertise-address ${NEWIP} \
  --apiserver-cert-extra-sans ${NEWIP}

4) Restart kubelet
sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Kubelet will automatically restart the etcd and kube-apiserver static pods with the updated manifests and certificates.

5) Verify etcd is running
sudo crictl ps | grep etcd
sudo crictl logs $(sudo crictl ps -a --name etcd -q | head -n1)


etcd should now be Running.

Then check kube-apiserver:

sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver
kubectl get nodes


This step is mandatory because the certificate’s SAN must match the IP that etcd is listening on; otherwise TLS connections fail and the pod keeps exiting.

Once this is done, the cluster should recover and the workers can reconnect.

Do you want me to give a one-liner set of commands that updates manifests, regenerates all certificates, and restarts kubelet in one go? This avoids missing any remaining references.

[certs] Using existing apiserver certificate and key on disk
ChatGPT said:

Ah — that message tells us the apiserver certificate already exists, so kubeadm didn’t regenerate it. That’s why etcd/kube-apiserver may still fail with the old IP in the certificate.

To fix it, you need to force regeneration of the apiserver cert and also etcd certs so the new IP is included in the SAN.

1) Back up the old certs
sudo mkdir -p /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup
sudo cp -r /etc/kubernetes/pki/* /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/

2) Regenerate etcd and apiserver certificates with new IP
NEWIP=<your-new-IP>  # replace with actual new control-plane IP

# etcd certs
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server --apiserver-advertise-address $NEWIP --apiserver-cert-extra-sans $NEWIP
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client

# force apiserver cert regeneration
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --apiserver-advertise-address $NEWIP --apiserver-cert-extra-sans $NEWIP --force


Key: the --force flag forces kubeadm to overwrite the existing apiserver certificate with a new one including the new IP in the SAN.

3) Restart kubelet
sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Kubelet will pick up the new static pod manifests and start etcd + apiserver with the correct certificates.

4) Verify etcd and apiserver are running
sudo crictl ps | grep -E 'etcd|kube-apiserver'
kubectl get nodes


At this point, etcd should be running, kube-apiserver should be healthy, and the cluster will accept connections from workers.

After this, you should also update /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf and worker nodes kubeconfigs to point to the new IP, if you haven’t already.

Do you want me to give a full sequence to update etcd manifests, regenerate all certs, and restart the cluster safely in one go?

ChatGPT said:

Ah, the error happened because your cp -r command tried to copy everything in /etc/kubernetes/pki/, including the backup folder you just created, into itself. That causes an infinite recursion.

To fix it, exclude the backup folder when copying:

sudo rsync -av --exclude backup /etc/kubernetes/pki/ /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/


rsync is safer here; it will copy everything except the backup folder itself.

After this, you’ll have a full backup of the PKI files in /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/.

Then you can safely proceed with regenerating etcd and apiserver certificates using the steps we discussed earlier.

Do you want me to give the exact next commands for regenerating all certs after this backup?

ChatGPT said:

Ah — that explains it. In your kubeadm version (v1.33), the kubeadm init phase certs apiserver command does not support the --apiserver-advertise-address flag. That’s why you’re seeing:

unknown flag: --apiserver-advertise-address

✅ Correct approach for v1.33

Regenerate apiserver certificate (force)
Simply run:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --force


This will overwrite the existing apiserver.crt and apiserver.key.

The SANs come from /etc/kubernetes/kubeadm-config.yaml (or the cluster config kubeadm used).

Check if the new IP is in the etcd SAN
For etcd, the important certificates are:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client


If your control-plane IP changed, kubeadm will not automatically include it in the existing SANs. So it’s safer to regenerate all etcd certs after editing /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml to use the new IP.

Restart kubelet to pick up the static pods:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Verify etcd and kube-apiserver pods are running:

sudo crictl ps | grep -E 'etcd|kube-apiserver'
kubectl get nodes


✅ Key point: In v1.33, you cannot pass the new IP directly via flags for apiserver certs. To include the new IP in SAN:

Update your kubeadm cluster config (/etc/kubernetes/kubeadm-config.yaml) to include the new IP in apiServer.certSANs.

Then rerun:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --config /etc/kubernetes/kubeadm-config.yaml --force


This ensures the apiserver cert contains the new IP.

If you want, I can give a complete step-by-step sequence for v1.33 to fix the IP change: manifests, certs, kubeconfigs, and restarting the cluster safely. This will bring etcd + apiserver + workers back online.

You said:
invoked:
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --force

unknown flag: --force
To see the stack trace of this error execute with --v=5 or higher
ChatGPT said:

Ah — that confirms it: in v1.33, kubeadm init phase certs apiserver does not support --force or --apiserver-advertise-address. That’s why both commands failed.

This means you cannot directly force kubeadm to regenerate the apiserver certificate with a new IP via flags. You have two safe options:

Option 1 — Manual certificate regeneration (recommended)

Backup old PKI:

sudo mkdir -p /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup
sudo rsync -av --exclude backup /etc/kubernetes/pki/ /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/


Delete the old apiserver certificate (it will be recreated on next kubelet restart if using static pods):

sudo rm /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.key


Update /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml to use the new IP wherever --advertise-address or --etcd-servers appear.

Restart kubelet so static pods regenerate/reload certs:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Check pod status:

sudo crictl ps -a | grep kube-apiserver
sudo crictl logs <kube-apiserver-pod-id>

Option 2 — Regenerate apiserver cert using kubeadm config file

Create or edit a kubeadm config file (/tmp/kubeadm-config.yaml) including the new IP:

apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3
kind: ClusterConfiguration
apiServer:
  certSANs:
    - "<NEW-IP>"


Then regenerate the certificate:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --config /tmp/kubeadm-config.yaml


This tells kubeadm explicitly what SANs to include.

After this, restart kubelet.

✅ Next steps

Update etcd static pod manifest to use the new IP everywhere (/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml), including annotations.

Regenerate etcd certificates using kubeadm phases:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client


Restart kubelet:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Verify cluster health:

kubectl get nodes
sudo crictl ps | grep -E 'etcd|kube-apiserver'


If you want, I can give you a single, sequential list of commands for v1.33 that will:

Update etcd and apiserver manifests

Regenerate all required certs

Restart kubelet

Update kubeconfigs on control-plane and worker nodes

…so the cluster comes fully back online with the new IP.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
In the kube-apiserver.yaml file, I have this line:
--etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379

Do I change that to the new ip address as well?

ChatGPT said:

No — you do not need to change --etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379 to the new external IP.

Here’s why:

The apiserver communicates with etcd locally on the control-plane node via 127.0.0.1 (loopback).

Etcd is running as a static pod on the same node, so it already listens on 127.0.0.1:2379 for client connections.

Changing this to the new external IP is unnecessary and can actually break TLS connectivity if the certificate SANs don’t match the IP.

✅ What does need to be updated:

/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml

Replace all occurrences of the old control-plane IP with the new one (advertise-client-urls, listen-peer-urls, initial-advertise-peer-urls, annotations).

Certificates

Regenerate etcd certs to include the new IP in SANs (etcd-server, etcd-peer, etcd-healthcheck-client, apiserver-etcd-client).

Regenerate apiserver cert with the new IP in SANs.

kubeconfigs

Update admin.conf, controller-manager.conf, scheduler.conf with the new control-plane IP.

Update kubelet configs on workers if needed.

💡 TL;DR:
--etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379 stays as-is. Only the IP references in etcd manifests, certificates, and kubeconfigs need to change.

If you want, I can give you a complete checklist with exact commands to fix everything so the cluster comes back online safely.

ChatGPT said:

The output shows that the kube-apiserver pod keeps exiting:

Exited              kube-apiserver


This usually happens when etcd is not running properly or the apiserver certificate SANs do not include the IP/hostname it’s trying to bind to. Since we know the control-plane IP changed, both of these are likely causes.

Immediate checks

Check kube-apiserver logs (replace <ID> with the most recent container ID, e.g., 31f65c5647c0c):

sudo crictl logs 31f65c5647c0c


Look for errors like:

connection refused to etcd

TLS errors (x509: certificate is valid for ...)

listen tcp ...: bind: cannot assign requested address

Check etcd pod status:

sudo crictl ps -a | grep etcd


If etcd is also Exited, kube-apiserver cannot start.

Etcd must be running before the apiserver can successfully start.

Likely root cause

From previous logs:

listen tcp 192.168.1.99:2380: bind: cannot assign requested address


Etcd is trying to bind to the old IP, so it never starts.

Kube-apiserver depends on etcd → it exits immediately.

Solution steps (summary)

Update etcd manifest /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml:

Replace all old IPs (192.168.1.99) with new IP ($NEWIP) in:

--initial-advertise-peer-urls

--listen-peer-urls

--advertise-client-urls

--listen-client-urls

kubeadm.kubernetes.io/etcd.advertise-client-urls annotation

Regenerate etcd certificates to include new IP:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client


Restart kubelet (static pods reload manifests):

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Verify etcd is running:

sudo crictl ps | grep etcd
sudo crictl logs $(sudo crictl ps -a --name etcd -q | head -n1)


Once etcd is Running, kube-apiserver should start automatically. Check:

sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver
kubectl get nodes


✅ Key point: Do not change --etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379. Keep it pointing to 127.0.0.1; just fix etcd and certificates to match the new IP.

If you want, I can write a one-shot command sequence to fix manifests, regenerate all certs, restart kubelet, and verify that the cluster comes back online safely. This avoids missing any leftover IP references.

ChatGPT said:

Ah — that error means the container ID you tried to view no longer exists. crictl only shows logs for currently existing containers, and exited containers may get removed automatically depending on the runtime configuration.

To see the latest kube-apiserver logs, do this instead:

# List all kube-apiserver containers, including exited ones
sudo crictl ps -a | grep kube-apiserver

# Get the most recent container ID
CONTAINER_ID=$(sudo crictl ps -a --name kube-apiserver -q | head -n1)

# Show logs for that container
sudo crictl logs $CONTAINER_ID


Using --name kube-apiserver -q | head -n1 ensures you pick the most recent kube-apiserver container, even if previous ones were removed.

If the container keeps exiting immediately, the logs will show the exact error causing it to fail (most likely etcd connection or TLS certificate mismatch due to the IP change).

Once you can see the logs, you’ll know whether the next step is fixing etcd, regenerating certs, or updating kubeconfigs.

ChatGPT said:

Got it — the output shows kube-apiserver is still repeatedly exiting, meaning it’s not able to start. This is expected given your cluster’s etcd is not running and/or the certificates still reference the old IP.

Here’s what’s happening:

The apiserver depends on etcd for its data.

Etcd fails to start because its static pod manifest /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml still references the old IP and/or its certificates do not include the new IP in the SAN.

As a result, kube-apiserver cannot connect to etcd, so it immediately exits.

Correct sequence to fix the cluster after control-plane IP change
1️⃣ Backup PKI
sudo mkdir -p /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup
sudo rsync -av --exclude backup /etc/kubernetes/pki/ /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/

2️⃣ Update etcd manifest

Edit /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml and replace all old IP references with the new IP:

--initial-advertise-peer-urls

--listen-peer-urls

--advertise-client-urls

--listen-client-urls

kubeadm.kubernetes.io/etcd.advertise-client-urls annotation

3️⃣ Regenerate etcd certificates
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client

4️⃣ Regenerate apiserver certificate with new SAN

Create a minimal kubeadm config to include new IP:

apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3
kind: ClusterConfiguration
apiServer:
  certSANs:
    - "<NEW-IP>"


Save as /tmp/kubeadm-config.yaml.

Regenerate apiserver cert:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --config /tmp/kubeadm-config.yaml

5️⃣ Restart kubelet
sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Kubelet will recreate static pods for etcd and kube-apiserver.

6️⃣ Verify etcd and kube-apiserver
sudo crictl ps | grep -E 'etcd|kube-apiserver'
kubectl get nodes


Etcd must be Running first, then kube-apiserver.

Once both are running, workers should reconnect automatically.

💡 Important: Keep --etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379 in the apiserver manifest — do not change it to the new IP. Apiserver communicates with etcd locally.

This sequence is the safe way to recover your cluster after a control-plane IP change.

I can also provide a one-shot command list that applies all these steps sequentially without missing any IP reference, if you want. Do you want me to do that?

Is this OK?
ChatGPT said:

Ah — that output means kubeadm is not actually regenerating the certificates; it’s just reusing the existing ones:

[certs] Using existing etcd/server certificate and key on disk
[certs] Using existing etcd/peer certificate and key on disk
...

Why this happens

Kubeadm won’t overwrite existing certificates by default.

Since your old certificates contain the old IP in the SAN, this is exactly why etcd cannot bind to the new IP and the apiserver keeps failing.

Simply running the kubeadm init phase certs etcd-* commands without first removing the old certs will not fix the issue.

Correct way to regenerate etcd certs for a new IP

Backup the PKI (you already did this):

sudo mkdir -p /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup
sudo rsync -av --exclude backup /etc/kubernetes/pki/ /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/


Remove the existing etcd certificates:

sudo rm /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.* \
        /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.* \
        /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.* \
        /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.*


Regenerate the certificates:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client


After this, the new certificates will include the correct new IP in the SANs (assuming you also updated the static pod manifest /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml).

Restart kubelet so the static pods pick up the new certificates:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


💡 Important note:

Do not touch --etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379 in the apiserver manifest — keep it pointing to localhost.

Once etcd starts successfully, kube-apiserver should also start.

If you want, I can provide a full one-shot recovery command sequence for your cluster so everything (etcd + apiserver + certificates) comes up with the new IP. This avoids any leftover old IP references.

Do you want me to do that?

ChatGPT said:

Perfect — that output shows that new certificates are now being generated. ✅

Key points to note from the output:

[certs] etcd/server serving cert is signed for DNS names [k8-controller localhost] and IPs [192.168.1.98 127.0.0.1 ::1]
[certs] etcd/peer serving cert is signed for DNS names [k8-controller localhost] and IPs [192.168.1.98 127.0.0.1 ::1]


They are being generated for your new control-plane IP (192.168.1.98).

This fixes the previous problem where etcd was trying to bind to the new IP but the old certificate only had the old IP.

Next steps

Restart kubelet so static pods pick up the new certificates:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Verify etcd is running:

sudo crictl ps | grep etcd
sudo crictl logs $(sudo crictl ps -a --name etcd -q | head -n1)


Once etcd is running, check kube-apiserver:

sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver
sudo crictl logs $(sudo crictl ps -a --name kube-apiserver -q | head -n1)


Check cluster status:

kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n kube-system


💡 Important: Keep --etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379 in the apiserver manifest. Apiserver connects to etcd via localhost, so it does not need the external IP.

After these steps, your control-plane should come back online with the new IP, and worker nodes should reconnect automatically.

If you want, I can give a complete sequence of commands from PKI backup → regenerate etcd & apiserver certs → restart kubelet → verify cluster so you can run it safely in one shot.

ChatGPT said:

Ah — right now crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver shows nothing, which means the kube-apiserver static pod is not running yet. This is usually because etcd is not fully up or there is still a certificate / manifest mismatch.

Things to check immediately:

Verify etcd is running:

sudo crictl ps | grep etcd


Etcd must be in Running state first.

If etcd is Exited, check logs:

ETCD_ID=$(sudo crictl ps -a --name etcd -q | head -n1)
sudo crictl logs $ETCD_ID


Check etcd manifest /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml:

Make sure all references to the old IP are replaced with the new control-plane IP (advertise-client-urls, listen-peer-urls, initial-advertise-peer-urls, annotations).

Restart kubelet so static pods are recreated with the updated manifest and certificates:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Watch the static pods:

sudo crictl ps -a | grep kube-apiserver
sudo crictl logs $(sudo crictl ps -a --name kube-apiserver -q | head -n1)


✅ Summary:

Kube-apiserver will not start until etcd is healthy.

Once etcd starts with the new IP and regenerated certificates, kube-apiserver should launch automatically.

If you want, I can give a step-by-step recovery sequence that ensures etcd + apiserver come up correctly after a control-plane IP change. This will avoid missing any IP references or leftover old certificates.

Great — etcd is now Running ✅

This is the crucial step, because kube-apiserver depends on etcd.

Next steps

Check kube-apiserver logs to see why it’s not running yet:

APISERVER_ID=$(sudo crictl ps -a --name kube-apiserver -q | head -n1)
sudo crictl logs $APISERVER_ID


Look for errors like TLS certificate issues or binding failures.

Restart kubelet so the static pod picks up the regenerated certificates and updated manifests:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Watch kube-apiserver status:

sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver
kubectl get nodes


Kube-apiserver should come up automatically now.

Once it’s Running, the workers should reconnect to the control plane.

💡 Key points to ensure success:

Kube-apiserver manifest should still have:

--etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379


No old IP references in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml.

Certificates for etcd and apiserver-etcd-client must include the new IP.

If kube-apiserver still doesn’t start after restarting kubelet, the logs will tell the exact cause — likely a leftover SAN issue in the apiserver certificate.

Ah — that explains why kube-apiserver is still not starting.

err="open /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt: no such file or directory"


It is missing the apiserver certificate. This certificate must be regenerated to include your new control-plane IP.

Fix: regenerate apiserver certificate

Backup your PKI (if not already done):

sudo mkdir -p /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup
sudo rsync -av --exclude backup /etc/kubernetes/pki/ /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/


Remove the old apiserver certs (so kubeadm will generate new ones):

sudo rm /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.*


Generate a new apiserver certificate including the new IP:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --apiserver-cert-extra-sans 192.168.1.98


Replace 192.168.1.98 with your new control-plane IP.

Restart kubelet so the static pod uses the new certificate:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Check that kube-apiserver is running:

sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver
kubectl get nodes


✅ After this, etcd is already running, the apiserver now has a valid certificate, and the control plane should come back online.

Do you want me to give the full recovery sequence from etcd + apiserver cert regeneration through kubelet restart to cluster verification? This ensures nothing is missed.

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — here’s a safe, step-by-step recovery sequence for your Kubernetes control plane after an IP change. This ensures etcd + kube-apiserver certificates + manifests are all updated and the cluster comes back online.

1️⃣ Backup existing PKI
sudo mkdir -p /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup
sudo rsync -av --exclude backup /etc/kubernetes/pki/ /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/

2️⃣ Update static pod manifests

Edit /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml:

Replace all old IPs with the new control-plane IP:

--initial-advertise-peer-urls=https://<NEW-IP>:2380
--listen-peer-urls=https://<NEW-IP>:2380
--advertise-client-urls=https://<NEW-IP>:2379
--listen-client-urls=https://127.0.0.1:2379,https://<NEW-IP>:2379


Update the annotation:

kubeadm.kubernetes.io/etcd.advertise-client-urls: https://<NEW-IP>:2379


Note: Leave --etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379 in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml. Do not change it to the new IP.

3️⃣ Remove old certificates that reference the old IP
sudo rm /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.*
sudo rm /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.*
sudo rm /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.*
sudo rm /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.*
sudo rm /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.*

4️⃣ Regenerate etcd certificates
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client


This will create etcd certs including the new IP.

5️⃣ Regenerate apiserver certificate with the new IP
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --apiserver-cert-extra-sans <NEW-IP>


Replace <NEW-IP> with your control-plane IP.

This fixes the apiserver.crt: no such file error.

6️⃣ Restart kubelet
sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Kubelet will recreate etcd and kube-apiserver static pods with the updated manifests and certificates.

7️⃣ Verify cluster components
Check etcd:
sudo crictl ps | grep etcd
sudo crictl logs $(sudo crictl ps -a --name etcd -q | head -n1)

Check kube-apiserver:
sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver
sudo crictl logs $(sudo crictl ps -a --name kube-apiserver -q | head -n1)

Check nodes and system pods:
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n kube-system


✅ Expected outcome:

etcd is Running with the new IP.

kube-apiserver is Running and using new certificates.

Worker nodes reconnect automatically.

kubectl get nodes shows all nodes Ready.

If you want, I can also give a single block of shell commands that you can paste and run, which executes all of the above safely in sequence. This avoids any missed steps or manual edits.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
yes

Perfect — here’s a ready-to-run shell sequence to recover your Kubernetes control plane after changing the controller IP. ✅

⚠️ Warning: This modifies PKI and static pod manifests. Make sure you have a backup (the first commands do this).

echo "Kube-apiserver:"
sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver

echo "Cluster nodes:"
kubectl get nodes

echo "Kube-system pods:"
kubectl get pods -n kube-system


This will:

Backup all certificates.

Update the etcd static pod manifest with the new IP.

Remove old etcd/apiserver certificates.

Regenerate certificates for etcd + kube-apiserver.

Restart kubelet so static pods use the new certs.

Verify the cluster components are running.

If you run this and kubectl get nodes still shows issues, we can quickly troubleshoot worker node reconnection.

Do you want me to add a final check to force workers to rejoin automatically?

You said:
Invoked:
kubectl delete ns prometheus

Result:
namespace "prometheus" deleted
.

seems to hang

ChatGPT said:

Ah — that “hanging” delete usually happens when Kubernetes cannot fully clean up finalizers for resources in that namespace.

Why it hangs

Some resources (CRDs, custom resources, or stuck pods) have finalizers that prevent deletion.

The namespace deletion will stay in Terminating state until all finalizers are removed.

You can check the status:

kubectl get ns prometheus -o yaml


Look for:

status:
  phase: Terminating
spec:
  finalizers:
  - kubernetes
  - some-crd-finalizer

How to force delete the namespace

Edit the namespace to remove finalizers:

kubectl get ns prometheus -o json > /tmp/prometheus.json


Open the file /tmp/prometheus.json in an editor and remove the finalizers array entirely:

"spec": {
  "finalizers": []
}


Apply the change to force deletion:

kubectl replace --raw "/api/v1/namespaces/prometheus/finalize" -f /tmp/prometheus.json


After this, the namespace should disappear immediately.

⚠️ Caution: This skips cleanup of some resources inside the namespace, but it’s safe if you just want the namespace gone.

Do you want me to give a single command version that forces delete without editing JSON manually?

You said:
I delete the prometheus namespaced.
However, there is a bastard pod lingering:

prometheus    prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb                1/1     Running   10 (9h ago)     2d1h

When I invoked:
delete pod prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb -ns prometheus

Result:
Error from server (NotFound): pods "prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb" not found
Error from server (NotFound): pods "prometheus" not found
ChatGPT said:

Ah — this is a classic stale or “ghost” pod situation. Kubernetes thinks the pod exists (it’s in etcd), but the API server cannot actually find it anymore. That’s why kubectl delete pod returns NotFound.

This usually happens after:

Deleting a namespace abruptly

Etcd or kube-apiserver got restarted

Or the pod was removed from the API but the cache hasn’t fully updated

Steps to resolve a ghost pod

Check the namespace status

kubectl get ns prometheus -o yaml


Make sure it is actually gone or at least not stuck in Terminating.

If the namespace is Terminating, follow the finalizer removal procedure I gave earlier.

Check etcd directly for the lingering pod

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb --prefix --keys-only


You may need to point etcdctl to your cluster endpoint and certs:

export ETCDCTL_API=3
etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  get /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb --keys-only


Delete it manually from etcd

⚠️ Be very careful — modifying etcd directly can break your cluster if done incorrectly.

etcdctl del /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb


Force kubelet to remove any stale container

On the node where the pod was running, check container runtime:

sudo crictl ps -a | grep prometheus
sudo crictl rm <container-id>


This ensures the container is gone locally.

Verify the pod is removed

kubectl get pods -A | grep prometheus


It should no longer appear.

💡 Summary:
The pod is a “ghost” because it exists in etcd or kubelet state but not in the API. Deleting it from etcd and cleaning up the node removes it fully.

I can give you a single set of commands to clean this ghost pod safely without touching other resources. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Invoked:
kubectl get ns prometheus -o yaml

Result:
Error from server (NotFound): namespaces "prometheus" not found
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — that means the namespace is already deleted, so the lingering pod is just a “ghost” in etcd or the node’s container runtime.

Here’s how to clean it up safely:

1️⃣ Check for the container on the node
sudo crictl ps -a | grep prometheus


This will show any running or exited containers for that pod.

2️⃣ Remove the stale container
sudo crictl rm <container-id>


Replace <container-id> with the ID shown from the previous command.

If there’s more than one container for that pod, remove them all.

3️⃣ Verify removal
sudo crictl ps -a | grep prometheus
kubectl get pods -A | grep prometheus


The ghost pod should no longer appear.

⚠️ Note:
Since the namespace is gone, there’s no need to touch etcd directly — removing the container from the node is sufficient to stop it from showing up in kubectl get pods.

If you want, I can give a single command that cleans up any lingering containers from deleted namespaces so you don’t have to track them manually. Do you want me to do that?

You said:

ChatGPT said:

Got it — so crictl isn’t showing any Prometheus containers. That means:

The namespace is gone (kubectl get ns prometheus shows NotFound).

The node has no leftover container (crictl ps -a shows nothing).

The pod you saw earlier (prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb) is now just a stale entry in the kubectl cache or was already removed from the cluster, which is why kubectl delete pod returned NotFound.

✅ At this point, there is nothing left to clean up. Your cluster is consistent — the “ghost pod” will disappear from future kubectl get pods outputs because the namespace is gone.

You can double-check with:

kubectl get pods -A | grep prometheus


It should return nothing.

No further action is needed.

Do you want me to explain why it still showed in your previous kubectl get pods?

You said:
Invoked:
kubectl get pods -A | grep prometheus

Result:
prometheus    prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb                1/1     Running   10 (9h ago)     2d1h

It is still there
ChatGPT said:

Ah — now it’s clear: the pod is stuck in a “terminating / orphaned” state. Even though the namespace was deleted, the pod object still exists in etcd, and the API server hasn’t fully reconciled it. That’s why it still shows up in kubectl get pods -A.

Since kubectl delete pod says NotFound, we need to force remove it directly from etcd or the kubelet.

Option 1: Remove via kubelet (safest)

Find the node where the pod is running:

kubectl get pod prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb -A -o wide


SSH into that node and check the container runtime:

sudo crictl ps -a | grep prometheus


Remove the container:

sudo crictl rm <container-id>


Repeat if multiple containers appear.

Verify:

sudo crictl ps -a | grep prometheus
kubectl get pods -A | grep prometheus

Option 2: Remove directly from etcd (last resort)

⚠️ Dangerous — this touches etcd directly. Only do this if Option 1 fails.

export ETCDCTL_API=3

etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  del /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb


Then refresh kube-apiserver cache:

kubectl get pods -A


💡 In almost all cases, removing the container from the node is enough, and the ghost pod disappears automatically.

I can write a single command sequence that safely cleans this pod without touching etcd manually if you want. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Invoked:
kubectl get pod prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb -A -o wide

Result:
error: a resource cannot be retrieved by name across all namespaces
ChatGPT said:

Ah — that error is expected because you’re trying to get a pod by name across all namespaces, and kubectl does not allow -A (all namespaces) with get pod <name>. It only works if you specify the namespace.

Since the prometheus namespace is already deleted, Kubernetes has no namespace for this pod, which is why kubectl get pod fails. Yet kubectl get pods -A | grep prometheus still shows it — that’s the stale / orphaned pod entry we talked about.

At this point:

The namespace is gone.

The pod is “stuck in etcd” or in kubelet state.

What to do next

Check which node (if any) thinks it’s running the pod:

kubectl get pods -A -o wide | grep prometheus


Look at the NODE column.

SSH to that node and run:

sudo crictl ps -a | grep prometheus


If it shows a container, remove it:

sudo crictl rm <container-id>


If crictl shows nothing, then it’s purely a stale etcd / kube-apiserver cache entry, and you will need to remove it via etcd as a last resort (the etcdctl del /registry/pods/... command I gave earlier).

So the key here is: kubectl get pod <name> -A will never work, because a pod must belong to a namespace. The pod is orphaned, which is why get pod fails but get pods -A still lists it.

Do you want me to give the exact etcd commands to remove this ghost pod safely?

You said:
invoked:
kubectl get pods -A -o wide | grep prometheus

Result:
prometheus    prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb                1/1     Running   10 (9h ago)     2d1h    10.244.194.195   vbox-ubuntu     <none>           <none>

What is the command to ssh into that node?
ChatGPT said:

From your output, the pod is running on node vbox-ubuntu.

If your local machine can SSH into that node, the command is typically:

ssh <username>@vbox-ubuntu


Replace <username> with a user that has sudo privileges on that node.

If the node uses a private IP instead of a hostname, you can use that IP instead of vbox-ubuntu. Example:

ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.50


Once you’re on the node, you can check for the lingering pod container:

sudo crictl ps -a | grep prometheus


Then remove it with:

sudo crictl rm <container-id>


Do you want me to give the full sequence of commands to clean up this ghost pod after SSHing?

You said:
I have ssh'ed into that node.
Invoked:
sudo crictl ps -a | grep prometheus

Result:
nothing
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — that confirms there is no actual container running for that pod on the node. The pod is now purely a stale/orphaned entry in etcd.

Since crictl shows nothing and the namespace is gone, the only way to remove this ghost pod is to delete it directly from etcd.

Steps to safely remove the ghost pod from etcd

Set the etcd environment variable:

export ETCDCTL_API=3


Delete the pod key from etcd:

etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  del /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb


Verify removal:

kubectl get pods -A | grep prometheus


The pod should no longer appear.

⚠️ Important: Be very careful to delete only this pod’s key. Deleting the wrong etcd keys can break your cluster.

If you want, I can give a ready-to-run one-liner that safely removes just this ghost pod. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
invoked:
etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  del /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb

Result:
Error: open /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt: permission denied
ChatGPT said:

That error is happening because your current user doesn’t have permission to read the etcd certificate files. You need to run the command as root (or use sudo) so etcdctl can access the certs.

Try this:

sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  del /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb


After running it, verify:

kubectl get pods -A | grep prometheus


The pod should disappear.

Do you want me to explain why this pod got stuck in etcd even after the namespace was deleted?

You said:
still getting:
Error: open /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt: permission denied
ChatGPT said:

Ah — this usually happens if the file permissions on /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt are restricted even for root, or if your shell doesn’t propagate sudo to ETCDCTL_API=3.

Try this fully sudo-wrapped command to ensure etcdctl runs as root and can read the certs:

sudo sh -c 'ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  del /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb'


Explanation:

sudo sh -c '…' ensures the whole command runs as root, including the environment variable ETCDCTL_API=3.

This bypasses the permission error.

After running it, check:

kubectl get pods -A | grep prometheus


The pod should no longer appear.

If you want, I can also give a safer “list first, then delete” version so you can confirm the key exists in etcd before removing it. This is often safer in production. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
still getting:
Error: open /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt: permission denied
ChatGPT said:

Ah — now it’s clear. This is not just about sudo, it’s likely that the etcd certificate files are owned by root but with very restrictive permissions (for example, 600) and your shell’s sudo with sh -c isn’t enough to read them in the way etcdctl expects.

We can fix this in a safe, temporary way:

Option 1: Temporarily relax permissions
sudo chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
              /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
              /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt


Then run:

ETCDCTL_API=3 sudo etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  del /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb


After it succeeds, restore permissions:

sudo chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
              /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
              /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt

Option 2: Copy certs to a temporary location
sudo mkdir /tmp/etcd-certs
sudo cp /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/{ca.crt,server.crt,server.key} /tmp/etcd-certs/
sudo chown $(whoami) /tmp/etcd-certs/*


Then run:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/tmp/etcd-certs/ca.crt \
  --cert=/tmp/etcd-certs/server.crt \
  --key=/tmp/etcd-certs/server.key \
  del /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb


Either method should bypass the “permission denied” problem.

Do you want me to give the exact single-line command using Option 1 so you can just run it safely?

You said:
still getting:
Error: open /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt: permission denied
ChatGPT said:

Ah — thanks for clarifying. Since even sudo isn’t letting etcdctl read the certs, the issue is likely due to containerized etcd or strict filesystem permissions / AppArmor / SELinux restrictions on those cert files. On many kubeadm clusters, etcd runs as a static pod, and accessing its certs from the host can be blocked by the kubelet sandbox.

At this point, you have a few safe options:

Option 1: Use the etcd pod directly

If etcd is running as a pod:

Get the etcd pod ID:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l component=etcd -o wide


Exec into the etcd pod:

kubectl exec -n kube-system -it etcd-k8-controller -- /bin/sh


Run etcdctl inside the pod (cert files are accessible):

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  del /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb


This avoids host filesystem permission issues entirely.

Option 2: Temporarily copy certs from the pod
kubectl cp kube-system/etcd-k8-controller:/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd /tmp/etcd-certs


Then run etcdctl from your host using /tmp/etcd-certs, which should bypass permission issues.

This is the safest way to remove the ghost pod without breaking anything.

Do you want me to give the exact etcdctl command to remove this pod from inside the etcd pod?

ChatGPT said:

Perfect — your etcd is running as a static pod etcd-k8-controller. You can remove the ghost Prometheus pod from inside this etcd pod, which avoids any host permission issues.

Here’s exactly what to do:

Exec into the etcd pod:

kubectl exec -n kube-system -it etcd-k8-controller -- /bin/sh


Inside the pod, run etcdctl to delete the ghost pod key:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  del /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb


Exit the pod:

exit


Verify from the host:

kubectl get pods -A | grep prometheus


The ghost pod should now be gone.

If you want, I can also give a command to safely list all Prometheus-related keys in etcd first, so you can confirm exactly what will be deleted. This is often safer in production. Do you want me to provide that?

You said:
invoked:
kubectl exec -n kube-system -it etcd-k8-controller -- /bin/sh

Result:
error: Internal error occurred: error sending request: Post "https://192.168.1.99:10250/exec/kube-system/etcd-k8-controller/etcd?command=%2Fbin%2Fsh&input=1&output=1&tty=1": dial tcp 192.168.1.99:10250: connect: no route to host
ChatGPT said:

Ah — that error explains why kubectl exec isn’t working: the kubelet on the node running the etcd pod (192.168.1.99) is unreachable from your client. Port 10250 is the kubelet HTTPS port, and “no route to host” means your control machine (or wherever you’re running kubectl) cannot reach it over the network.

Because of this, kubectl exec into the etcd pod will fail.

At this point, the safest ways to fix the ghost pod are:

Option 1: Run etcdctl directly on the node

SSH into the node hosting the pod (192.168.1.99 — your controller), then run:

sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  del /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb


Using sudo on the host should bypass the previous permission errors.

Option 2: Delete the pod forcefully from the API server (less recommended)

If the pod metadata is corrupted in etcd, sometimes kubectl delete pod --force --grace-period=0 works:

kubectl delete pod prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb -n prometheus --force --grace-period=0


But since your namespace “prometheus” is already gone, etcd is the only reliable way.

Because you tried sudo earlier and still got “permission denied”, it likely means your /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt and key are owned by root and have restrictive permissions. On the controller node, you can do:

sudo ls -l /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/


Then, temporarily relax permissions just for the command:

sudo chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/{server.crt,server.key,ca.crt}
sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  del /registry/pods/prometheus/prometheus-5b8fbbb7f4-w2lbb


Then restore permissions.

If you want, I can give a ready-to-copy single command that will delete the ghost pod safely on the controller node without messing with other pods. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
192.168.1.99 is the OLD IP of the controller.  The new IP is 192.168.1.98.
ChatGPT said:

Ah! That explains a lot. Your lingering issues (kubectl exec failing, kube-apiserver/external pods still showing old IP, and “no route to host” errors) are all because etcd and kube-apiserver are still bound to the old IP (192.168.1.99). The cluster sees that IP as the control plane, but that address no longer exists.

Right now:

The kubelet on 192.168.1.98 is unreachable at the old IP.

etcd is still configured to advertise the old IP in its certificates and manifests.

kube-apiserver and kubelet static pods are still trying to use 192.168.1.99.

Next Steps

You need to fully update the control plane to use the new IP:

Update all static pod manifests on the controller (/etc/kubernetes/manifests/):

kube-apiserver.yaml → update --advertise-address to 192.168.1.98

kube-apiserver.yaml → update --etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379 if etcd is local, otherwise to new etcd IP

etcd.yaml → update --initial-advertise-peer-urls, --listen-peer-urls, --advertise-client-urls to 192.168.1.98

Regenerate etcd and kube-apiserver certificates to include the new IP in the SANs:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server --apiserver-advertise-address 192.168.1.98
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer --apiserver-advertise-address 192.168.1.98
sudo kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --apiserver-cert-extra-sans 192.168.1.98
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client


Restart the kubelet so the static pods reload:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Check pod status:

kubectl get pods -A


At this point, all control plane components should bind to the new IP (192.168.1.98), and your lingering Prometheus ghost pod can then be removed using normal kubectl delete pod (or via etcdctl if necessary).

If you want, I can give a complete sequence of commands to fully switch the control plane from 192.168.1.99 → 192.168.1.98, regenerate certificates, and fix etcd bindings so the cluster becomes healthy again. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
How do I know if etcd is local?
ChatGPT said:

You can tell if etcd is running locally on the controller node (as a static pod) by checking a few things:

1. Check static pod manifests

On the controller node:

ls /etc/kubernetes/manifests/


If you see etcd.yaml, it usually means etcd is running locally as a static pod on this node.

You can inspect it:

cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml


Look at:

--listen-client-urls=https://127.0.0.1:2379
--advertise-client-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2379


If 127.0.0.1 or the controller’s IP is listed, it’s local.

2. Check running containers
sudo crictl ps -a | grep etcd


If there’s a container like etcd-k8-controller running on the same node, it’s local.

3. Check endpoints from kube-apiserver
kubectl get pod -n kube-system -l component=etcd -o wide


If the NODE column shows your current controller node, it’s local.

If it points to a different machine, it’s remote.

✅ Conclusion

If you have etcd.yaml in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/ and the etcd pod runs on the same node, etcd is local.

If your kube-apiserver --etcd-servers flag points to 127.0.0.1:2379 or the controller’s IP, that also confirms it’s local.

Since your previous logs showed:

etcd-k8-controller   1/1     Running   1          2d10h   192.168.1.99   k8-controller


and your kube-apiserver was using --etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379, that means etcd is running locally on your controller node.

If you want, I can outline exactly how to switch the etcd static pod from the old IP to the new IP safely, without losing any data. Do you want me to do that?

[certs] Using existing apiserver-etcd-client certificate and key on disk

We've gone through this in previous steps already?
ChatGPT said:

Yes — this is exactly the same issue we saw before. The core problem is that kubeadm init phase certs no longer supports the flags you were trying to use in your version of kubeadm (v1.33.4).

Flags like --apiserver-advertise-address and --force are not valid for the certs subcommands in this version.

That’s why kubeadm is printing unknown flag: --apiserver-advertise-address.

As a result, kubeadm is just using the existing certificates on disk, which still contain the old IP (192.168.1.99) in the SANs.

This explains why your etcd and kube-apiserver pods are still trying to bind to the old IP, and why kubectl exec / static pod connections fail.

Implications

Regenerating certificates with kubeadm init phase certs will not update the SANs for the new IP in this version.

You must manually regenerate the certificates or use kubeadm alpha certs renew (depending on your version) with the correct SANs for the new IP.

I can give you a step-by-step procedure for manually regenerating etcd and kube-apiserver certificates to include the new IP and then restart the control plane so everything binds correctly.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect. Since your cluster is on kubeadm v1.33 and the standard kubeadm init phase certs commands don’t accept the IP flags, we’ll need to manually regenerate certificates with the new controller IP (192.168.1.98) and then restart the static pods so the cluster binds to the new IP. Here’s a clear step-by-step procedure:

1️⃣ Backup existing certificates and manifests
sudo mkdir -p /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup
sudo cp -r /etc/kubernetes/pki/* /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/
sudo cp -r /etc/kubernetes/manifests/* /etc/kubernetes/manifests/backup/

2️⃣ Update etcd manifest

Edit /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml:

Update all references to the old IP (192.168.1.99) to the new IP (192.168.1.98) in:

--initial-advertise-peer-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2380
--listen-peer-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2380
--advertise-client-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2379
--listen-client-urls=https://127.0.0.1:2379,https://192.168.1.98:2379
--initial-cluster=k8-controller=https://192.168.1.98:2380


Make sure --name=k8-controller matches your node name.

3️⃣ Generate new etcd certificates

We’ll generate new certificates with the new IP in the SANs. Example using openssl:

cd /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd

# Generate CA if needed (skip if you have existing etcd/ca.crt and ca.key)
sudo openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
sudo openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -subj "/CN=etcd-ca" -days 3650 -out ca.crt

# Generate server key + CSR
sudo openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
sudo openssl req -new -key server.key -subj "/CN=etcd" -out server.csr \
  -config <(cat <<EOF
[req]
distinguished_name=req
[ v3_ext ]
subjectAltName=IP:127.0.0.1,IP:192.168.1.98,DNS:k8-controller
EOF
)

# Sign server certificate with CA
sudo openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
  -out server.crt -days 365 -extensions v3_ext -extfile <(cat <<EOF
[ v3_ext ]
subjectAltName=IP:127.0.0.1,IP:192.168.1.98,DNS:k8-controller
EOF
)


Repeat for:

peer.crt / peer.key (CN=etcd-peer)

healthcheck-client.crt / healthcheck-client.key

apiserver-etcd-client.crt / apiserver-etcd-client.key

Make sure all the new certificates include 192.168.1.98 in the SANs.

4️⃣ Update kube-apiserver manifest

Edit /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml:

Update --advertise-address=192.168.1.98

Update --etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379 (if etcd is local) or the proper etcd endpoint

Ensure --cert-dir=/etc/kubernetes/pki points to your new certs

5️⃣ Restart kubelet / static pods
sudo systemctl restart kubelet


The manifests in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/ are automatically picked up by kubelet as static pods.

Check status:

kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get nodes -o wide


kube-apiserver and etcd should now show 192.168.1.98 as the IP.

6️⃣ Verify connectivity
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get nodes
kubectl cluster-info


Everything should now communicate properly via the new IP.

You can now safely remove the lingering Prometheus pod if needed.

If you want, I can write a ready-to-run sequence of commands that regenerates all etcd and kube-apiserver certificates with the new IP, updates manifests, and restarts the static pods safely.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
invoked:
sudo cp -r /etc/kubernetes/pki/* /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/

result:
cp: cannot copy a directory, '/etc/kubernetes/pki/backup', into itself, '/etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/backup'
angelc
ChatGPT said:

Ah — that error happens because cp -r /etc/kubernetes/pki/* /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/ tries to copy the contents including the backup folder itself if it already exists inside /etc/kubernetes/pki. So it ends up trying to copy backup into backup/backup, which isn’t allowed.

You have a few options:

Option 1: Use rsync (safest)
sudo rsync -a --exclude 'backup' /etc/kubernetes/pki/ /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/


This will copy everything except the backup folder itself.

Option 2: Temporarily move backup
sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup /tmp/
sudo cp -r /etc/kubernetes/pki/* /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/
sudo mv /tmp/backup /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/


This avoids the recursive copy problem.

✅ Recommendation

I usually use Option 1 (rsync) — simpler and avoids mistakes.

Do you want me to give the full command sequence to regenerate etcd and kube-apiserver certs after this backup?

You said:
ye
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! Here’s a full step-by-step sequence to safely regenerate your etcd and kube-apiserver certificates with the new controller IP (192.168.1.98), update manifests, and restart the static pods.

1️⃣ Backup existing certificates and manifests
# Backup pki
sudo mkdir -p /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup
sudo rsync -a --exclude 'backup' /etc/kubernetes/pki/ /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/

# Backup manifests
sudo mkdir -p /etc/kubernetes/manifests/backup
sudo cp -r /etc/kubernetes/manifests/* /etc/kubernetes/manifests/backup/

2️⃣ Update etcd manifest

Edit /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml and replace all old IPs with the new one (192.168.1.98):

--initial-advertise-peer-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2380
--listen-peer-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2380
--advertise-client-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2379
--listen-client-urls=https://127.0.0.1:2379,https://192.168.1.98:2379
--initial-cluster=k8-controller=https://192.168.1.98:2380


Make sure --name=k8-controller matches your node name.

3️⃣ Regenerate etcd certificates with new IP in SANs
cd /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd

# Generate server certificate
sudo openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
sudo openssl req -new -key server.key -subj "/CN=etcd" -out server.csr \
  -config <(cat <<EOF
[req]
distinguished_name=req
[ v3_ext ]
subjectAltName=IP:127.0.0.1,IP:192.168.1.98,DNS:k8-controller
EOF
)

# Sign server certificate
sudo openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
  -out server.crt -days 365 -extensions v3_ext -extfile <(cat <<EOF
[ v3_ext ]
subjectAltName=IP:127.0.0.1,IP:192.168.1.98,DNS:k8-controller
EOF
)


Repeat for:

peer.crt / peer.key (CN=etcd-peer)

healthcheck-client.crt / healthcheck-client.key

apiserver-etcd-client.crt / apiserver-etcd-client.key

All certificates must include 192.168.1.98 in SANs.

4️⃣ Update kube-apiserver manifest

Edit /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml:

--advertise-address=192.168.1.98
--etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379  # if etcd is local
--cert-dir=/etc/kubernetes/pki


Make sure any old IP references are updated.

5️⃣ Restart kubelet / static pods
sudo systemctl restart kubelet


The kubelet automatically recreates the static pods from the updated manifests.

Verify pod status:

kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get nodes -o wide


etcd and kube-apiserver should now bind to the new IP (192.168.1.98).

6️⃣ Verify cluster connectivity
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get pods -A


Make sure all nodes and system pods are healthy.

The lingering Prometheus pod can now be deleted safely if needed.

If you want, I can also give a single ready-to-run script that does all certificate regeneration for etcd and kube-apiserver automatically with the new IP.

Do you want me to prepare that script?

You said:
invoked:
sudo cp -r /etc/kubernetes/manifests/* /etc/kubernetes/manifests/backup/

result:
cp: cannot copy a directory, '/etc/kubernetes/manifests/backup', into itself, '/etc/kubernetes/manifests/backup/backup'
ChatGPT said:

Ah, the same problem as with the PKI backup: the backup folder already exists inside /etc/kubernetes/manifests, so cp -r tries to copy it into itself.

Solution 1: Use rsync to exclude the backup folder
sudo rsync -a --exclude 'backup' /etc/kubernetes/manifests/ /etc/kubernetes/manifests/backup/


This copies everything except the backup folder itself.

Solution 2: Temporarily move backup
sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/backup /tmp/
sudo cp -r /etc/kubernetes/manifests/* /etc/kubernetes/manifests/backup/
sudo mv /tmp/backup /etc/kubernetes/manifests/backup/


This avoids copying backup into itself.

Using Solution 1 (rsync) is simpler and safer.

Do you want me to provide the next steps for regenerating certificates after the backup?

Ah! This error happens because your shell or OpenSSL version doesn’t support process substitution (<(…)) on /dev/fd/*). On some systems (like older Ubuntu or certain containers), /dev/fd isn’t available.

Solution: Write the config to a temporary file

Then run:

sudo openssl req -new -key server.key -subj "/CN=etcd" -out server.csr -config /tmp/etcd_server_openssl.cnf


This avoids the /dev/fd issue.

You can do the same for peer, healthcheck-client, and apiserver-etcd-client certificates.

Do you want me to give a ready-to-run set of commands for all etcd certs with the new IP?

ChatGPT said:

Ah — the error Could not open file … server.key means OpenSSL cannot find server.key in your current directory. A few things to check:

Are you in the directory containing the key?
Example: if your etcd certs live in /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd, you need:

cd /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd


Use full path to the key instead of just server.key:

sudo openssl req -new -key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
    -subj "/CN=etcd" \
    -out /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.csr \
    -config /tmp/etcd_server_openssl.cnf


Ensure permissions allow reading:

sudo ls -l /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key


You may need sudo to read it if it’s root-owned.

If you want, I can write a full set of commands to regenerate all etcd certificates with the new IP using the proper paths so you avoid /dev/fd and missing file errors. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! Here’s a step-by-step, ready-to-run set of commands to regenerate your etcd certificates with the new controller IP (192.168.1.98) and avoid the /dev/fd and missing key issues. I’ll assume your etcd certs live in /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd.

1️⃣ Create temporary OpenSSL config files

2️⃣ Generate the CSRs
cd /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd

# Server
sudo openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -config /tmp/etcd_server_openssl.cnf -subj "/CN=etcd"

# Peer
sudo openssl req -new -key peer.key -out peer.csr -config /tmp/etcd_peer_openssl.cnf -subj "/CN=etcd-peer"

sudo openssl req -new -key apiserver-etcd-client.key -out apiserver-etcd-client.csr -config /tmp/apiserver_etcd_client_openssl.cnf -subj "/CN=apiserver-etcd-client"

3️⃣ Sign the CSRs with your etcd CA

    -out healthcheck-client.crt -days 365

# Apiserver etcd client
sudo openssl x509 -req -in apiserver-etcd-client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
    -out apiserver-etcd-client.crt -days 365

4️⃣ Verify the certificates
openssl x509 -in server.crt -text -noout | grep -A2 "Subject Alternative Name"


You should now see the new IP 192.168.1.98 listed.

✅ Notes

Make sure server.key, peer.key, healthcheck-client.key, and apiserver-etcd-client.key exist in /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd.

Always backup your existing certificates before overwriting.

If you want, I can provide the next steps to update the kube-apiserver and etcd manifests to use the new certificates so your cluster comes back online with the new controller IP.

Do you want me to do that next?

ChatGPT said:

Ah — that error is exactly what it looks like: OpenSSL cannot find the private key file apiserver-etcd-client.key. The command fails because the file doesn’t exist at the path you’re running it from.

Here’s how to fix it:

1️⃣ Confirm the key exists
ls -l /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/


You should see files like:

apiserver-etcd-client.key
server.key
peer.key
healthcheck-client.key
...


If apiserver-etcd-client.key is missing, that explains the error.

2️⃣ If the key is missing

You need to generate the key first:

cd /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd

sudo openssl genrsa -out apiserver-etcd-client.key 2048

3️⃣ Then generate the CSR
sudo openssl req -new -key apiserver-etcd-client.key \
  -out apiserver-etcd-client.csr \
  -config /tmp/apiserver_etcd_client_openssl.cnf \
  -subj "/CN=apiserver-etcd-client"

4️⃣ Sign the CSR with the etcd CA
sudo openssl x509 -req -in apiserver-etcd-client.csr \
  -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
  -out apiserver-etcd-client.crt -days 365


✅ After this, your apiserver-etcd-client.crt and key will exist and can be used by kube-apiserver to talk to etcd.

If you want, I can give the full list of commands to regenerate all etcd and apiserver certificates safely in the right order to avoid these missing key errors.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
I have a new ubuntu server I am going to use as a worker in the kubernetes cluster.  When I invoke the following command:

invoke:
sudo kubeadm join 192.168.1.98:6443 --token t0u22o.2qmw5yqupr0poxle --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:be2d7bde4f354f35ea9445a16247c5ac0b53d7c06645a901d70930927c78a7fb

[kubelet-start] Waiting for the kubelet to perform the TLS Bootstrap
error execution phase kubelet-wait-bootstrap: error writing CRISocket for this node: Unauthorized
To see the stack trace of this error execute with --v=5 or higher
ChatGPT said:

The error Unauthorized when running kubeadm join means the node cannot authenticate with the control plane. This happens for a few common reasons:

✅ Root Causes

The token is expired

By default, kubeadm join tokens expire after 24 hours.

You can check existing tokens on the control plane:

sudo kubeadm token list


If your token isn’t there, it’s expired.

Discovery token CA cert hash is incorrect

If the CA certificate changed (for example, when you regenerated certificates), the --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash will no longer match.

You can compute the correct hash on the controller:

openssl x509 -pubkey -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt | \
  openssl rsa -pubin -outform der 2>/dev/null | \
  sha256sum | awk '{print $1}'


The API server is unreachable

Verify the control plane IP and port:

curl -k https://192.168.1.98:6443/healthz


If this fails, check kube-apiserver status:

sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver


Mismatch in CRI socket (container runtime)

If the worker is using containerd, kubeadm needs the socket path:

sudo kubeadm join 192.168.1.98:6443 --token <token> \
  --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash> \
  --cri-socket unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock

✅ Fix Steps
Step 1: Create a new token on the control plane
sudo kubeadm token create


Output will look like:

abcdef.0123456789abcdef

Step 2: Get the correct CA cert hash
openssl x509 -pubkey -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt | \
  openssl rsa -pubin -outform der 2>/dev/null | \
  sha256sum | awk '{print $1}'

Step 3: Join the worker

On the worker:

sudo kubeadm join 192.168.1.98:6443 \
  --token <NEW_TOKEN> \
  --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<NEW_HASH> \
  --cri-socket unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock


⚠ If you regenerated control plane certificates earlier (especially ca.crt), you must use the updated hash.

Do you want me to give you the exact commands to run on the controller and the new worker (step-by-step with verification)?

You said:
In the controller:
invoke:
sudo kubeadm token list

result:
failed to list bootstrap tokens: Get "https://192.168.1.99:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/secrets?fieldSelector=type%3Dbootstrap.kubernetes.io%2Ftoken": dial tcp 192.168.1.99:6443: connect: no route to host
To see the stack trace of this error execute with --v=5 or higher

The controller server's IP address has changed to:
192.168.1.98

How do I get 'kubeadm token list' to point to the correct IP ?

ChatGPT said:

kubeadm token list connects to the API server via the kubeconfig file at /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf. That file still contains the old IP (192.168.1.99) in its server: field. You need to update it.

✅ Fix admin.conf to use the new IP (192.168.1.98)

Run this on the controller:

sudo sed -i 's/192.168.1.99/192.168.1.98/g' /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf


Then verify:

grep server /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf


Expected output:

server: https://192.168.1.98:6443

✅ Also update kubeconfig for root user and kubectl (if needed)

If you copied admin.conf to your home directory for kubectl:

sed -i 's/192.168.1.99/192.168.1.98/g' ~/.kube/config

✅ Test API connectivity
kubectl --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf get nodes


If you still get “no route to host”, it means kube-apiserver is not running or not bound to the new IP. To check:

sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver


If it’s not running or keeps exiting, the kube-apiserver.yaml in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/ still points to the old IP in these flags:

--advertise-address=192.168.1.99

--bind-address=192.168.1.99

Do you want me to give you the exact steps to update kube-apiserver manifest and restart the control plane pods so the API becomes reachable on 192.168.1.98? Or should we first confirm if the pod is running?

You said:
I checked admin.conf, it has the correct IP address:
    server: https://192.168.1.98:6443
  name: kubernetes
ChatGPT said:

Great, that means admin.conf is correct. The error:

dial tcp 192.168.1.99:6443: connect: no route to host


suggests that some process is still trying to talk to the old IP (192.168.1.99).

Here’s what could still be pointing to the old IP:

✅ 1. Check /etc/kubernetes/manifests/ for old IP

Run:

grep -R "192.168.1.99" /etc/kubernetes/manifests/


Common files to check:

kube-apiserver.yaml (--advertise-address and --bind-address)

etcd.yaml (--listen-peer-urls, --listen-client-urls)

controller-manager.yaml and scheduler.yaml (should reference 127.0.0.1 or the correct IP)

If you see the old IP in kube-apiserver.yaml or etcd.yaml, change it:

sudo sed -i 's/192.168.1.99/192.168.1.98/g' /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
sudo sed -i 's/192.168.1.99/192.168.1.98/g' /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml

✅ 2. Check kubelet’s config

Run:

grep "192.168.1.99" /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml || echo "No old IP in kubelet config"


If present, update:

sudo sed -i 's/192.168.1.99/192.168.1.98/g' /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml


Then restart kubelet:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet

✅ 3. Verify control plane pods

After updating manifests, kubelet will automatically restart the static pods.

Check:

sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver
sudo crictl ps | grep etcd


Once API server is running on the new IP, re-run:

sudo kubeadm token list


⚠ Question: Do you want me to give you the exact replacement commands for all manifests and configs so that every old IP reference is replaced in one go? Or do you want a safe step-by-step verification approach?

You said:
where can I find files controller-manager.yaml and scheduler.yaml?
ChatGPT said:

Those two files are part of the static Pod manifests for the control plane. They are typically located in:

/etc/kubernetes/manifests/

✅ Expected files in that directory:

kube-apiserver.yaml

etcd.yaml

kube-controller-manager.yaml

kube-scheduler.yaml

🔍 To confirm, run:
ls -l /etc/kubernetes/manifests/


If the directory exists, you’ll see those YAML files. These are managed by kubelet, which watches this directory and restarts static pods if the files change.

✅ If you don’t see them:

Either the control plane is running as static pods (default for kubeadm) → they should be there.

Or, it’s running as systemd services → then you need to check /etc/systemd/system/ or systemctl status kube-apiserver.

Do you want me to give you a one-liner command to search all manifest files for old IP (192.168.1.99) and replace it with the new IP (192.168.1.98) safely? Or do you prefer to manually edit and verify each file?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Here’s how to find and replace the old controller IP (192.168.1.99) with the new IP (192.168.1.98) in all the relevant manifest files under /etc/kubernetes/manifests/:

✅ One-liner command:
sudo sed -i 's/192\.168\.1\.99/192.168.1.98/g' /etc/kubernetes/manifests/*.yaml

✅ Verify changes:
grep -R "192.168.1" /etc/kubernetes/manifests/


You should now only see 192.168.1.98.

✅ Why this is important:

kube-controller-manager.yaml and kube-scheduler.yaml usually don’t hardcode the IP (they connect to the API via kubeconfig).

etcd.yaml and kube-apiserver.yaml almost always have the old IP in flags like:

--advertise-client-urls

--listen-peer-urls

--initial-cluster

--apiserver-advertise-address

✅ After editing:

Static pods are controlled by kubelet. Once you modify the manifests, kubelet will automatically restart the control plane components. To confirm:

sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver


You should see new containers starting shortly after the edit.

Do you want me to also give you the commands to verify the kubeconfig files (controller-manager.conf and scheduler.conf) to ensure they also point to the new IP? Or should I provide the full recovery checklist for the cluster after IP change?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Great, here’s the full recovery checklist to ensure your control plane and kubeconfigs are aligned after the IP change.

✅ 1. Verify kubeconfig files point to the new IP

These files are typically in /etc/kubernetes/:

admin.conf

controller-manager.conf

scheduler.conf

Run:

grep -R "192.168.1" /etc/kubernetes/*.conf


If you see 192.168.1.99, update it:

sudo sed -i 's/192\.168\.1\.99/192.168.1.98/g' /etc/kubernetes/*.conf

✅ 2. Check static pod manifests

Manifests are in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/:

grep -R "192.168.1" /etc/kubernetes/manifests/


Update:

sudo sed -i 's/192\.168\.1\.99/192.168.1.98/g' /etc/kubernetes/manifests/*.yaml


Especially check these flags:

--advertise-address (kube-apiserver)

--apiserver-advertise-address

--etcd-servers

--advertise-client-urls

--initial-cluster

✅ 3. Restart static pods

Static pods restart automatically when the manifest changes, but confirm:

sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver
sudo crictl ps | grep etcd

✅ 4. Verify certificates

If the new IP is not in SAN, API server and etcd will fail with TLS errors.
Check:

openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt -text -noout | grep -A 1 "Subject Alternative Name"


If old IP is still there, regenerate certs:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs all --apiserver-cert-extra-sans "192.168.1.98"


Backup first:

sudo mkdir -p /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup
sudo cp -r /etc/kubernetes/pki/* /etc/kubernetes/pki/backup/

✅ 5. Update kubelet config on workers

On each worker node:

sudo sed -i 's/192\.168\.1\.99/192.168.1.98/g' /var/lib/kubelet/kubelet.conf
sudo systemctl restart kubelet

✅ 6. Regenerate join token (if needed)

On the control plane:

sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command


This gives you the correct join command with the new IP.

✅ 7. Test

On the control plane:

kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A


👉 Do you want me to give you all commands in one script that:

Backs up configs

Updates IP in manifests & kubeconfigs

Restarts static pods

Verifies TLS cert SAN

Prints join command

? Or should I give separate commands for control plane and workers?

You said:
'sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command ' seems to be hanging
ChatGPT said:

If kubeadm token create hangs, that means the control plane is still trying to talk to the API server using the old IP or the API server isn't fully functional yet. Let’s troubleshoot step by step:

✅ 1. Check API server connectivity

On the controller node, run:

kubectl get componentstatuses


Or:

curl -k https://192.168.1.98:6443/healthz


If this hangs, the API server is not reachable (or certificate issue).

✅ 2. Check if kube-apiserver pod is running
crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver


If not running, check logs:

crictl logs <container_id>


Common reason: IP mismatch in certificates or manifest.

✅ 3. Confirm static pod manifest IP

Open:

/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml


Check:

--advertise-address=192.168.1.98


and NOT the old IP.
If wrong, fix and wait for container to restart.

✅ 4. Check etcd
crictl ps | grep etcd


If not running, open /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml and confirm:

--initial-advertise-peer-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2380
--listen-client-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2379,https://127.0.0.1:2379

✅ 5. Check for SAN issue

Run:

openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt -text -noout | grep -A1 "Subject Alternative Name"


Does it include 192.168.1.98?
If no, regenerate:

sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --apiserver-cert-extra-sans 192.168.1.98


Then delete old static pod for kube-apiserver so it restarts:

sudo rm /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
sudo kubeadm init phase control-plane all

✅ 6. After fixing, retry token:
sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command


⚠ Do you want me to give you a full set of sed commands to fix all IPs in all manifests (apiserver, etcd, controller-manager, scheduler) and regenerate certs in one go?
Or do you want me to walk you through fixing just the API server first so it becomes healthy?

To see the stack trace of this error execute with --v=5 or higher
ChatGPT said:

This confirms that kubeadm is still trying to connect to the old IP (192.168.1.99), even though admin.conf was updated.
That means some control plane components or configuration files are still referencing the old IP.

✅ Root Cause

API server is likely running with --advertise-address=192.168.1.99 OR etcd is still on the old IP.

Control plane static pods (/etc/kubernetes/manifests/*.yaml) still point to 192.168.1.99.

Some kubeconfig files still reference old IP.

✅ Fix Steps
1. Check all static pod manifests

Run:

grep -R "192.168.1.99" /etc/kubernetes/manifests/


If you see any references, update them to 192.168.1.98:

kube-apiserver.yaml

etcd.yaml

kube-controller-manager.yaml

kube-scheduler.yaml

Important fields to fix in kube-apiserver.yaml:

--advertise-address=192.168.1.98
--etcd-servers=https://192.168.1.98:2379


Important fields in etcd.yaml:

--initial-advertise-peer-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2380
--listen-client-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2379,https://127.0.0.1:2379
--advertise-client-urls=https://192.168.1.98:2379


After editing, the static pods will auto-restart.

2. Fix kubeconfig files

Check for old IP in these files:

/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
/etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
/etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf


Run:

grep -R "192.168.1.99" /etc/kubernetes/


If found, replace:

sudo sed -i 's/192.168.1.99/192.168.1.98/g' /etc/kubernetes/*.conf

3. Restart kubelet
sudo systemctl restart kubelet

4. Wait for pods to stabilize

Check:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system

5. Retry token
sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command


🔥 If you want, I can give you a single script to find and replace the old IP in all manifests, kubeconfigs, and restart services automatically.
Do you want me to generate that?

You said:
Can I just start from scratch and clean and purge the controller server and reinstantiate the cluster?  I need to create a playbook anyway on what to do if the IP changes on the controller server.
ChatGPT said:

Yes, you can completely reset the controller and start fresh. In fact, this is often easier (and cleaner) than manually fixing broken configs after an IP change—especially if you're writing an Ansible playbook for future automation.

✅ Steps to Wipe and Recreate the Controller

Here’s the clean approach:

1. Drain & Reset Workers (optional, if you want to keep them)

On each worker node:

sudo kubeadm reset -f
sudo systemctl stop kubelet
sudo systemctl stop containerd
sudo rm -rf /etc/kubernetes/ /var/lib/kubelet/ /var/lib/etcd /etc/cni/net.d
sudo systemctl start containerd


If you’re destroying everything, skip draining.

2. Reset the Controller Node

On the controller node:

sudo kubeadm reset -f
sudo systemctl stop kubelet
sudo systemctl stop containerd
sudo rm -rf /etc/kubernetes/ /var/lib/kubelet/ /var/lib/etcd /etc/cni/net.d
sudo systemctl start containerd

3. Reinitialize the Control Plane

Run:

sudo kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address=<NEW_IP> --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16


Replace <NEW_IP> with your controller’s current IP.

Keep the same Pod CIDR if you’re using a CNI like Calico or Flannel.

4. Set Up kubeconfig
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

5. Install Network Plugin (Calico, Flannel, etc.)

For Calico:

kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml

6. Get New Join Command
kubeadm token create --print-join-command

7. Rejoin Workers

Run the join command on each worker.

✅ For Your Playbook (IP Change Recovery Strategy)

You have two options when the controller IP changes:

Full Reset (Simpler, but disruptive)

Reset control plane & workers as above.

Reinit cluster, reapply manifests.

Update Configs (Advanced, non-disruptive)

Replace old IP in:

/etc/kubernetes/manifests/*.yaml

/etc/kubernetes/*.conf

Restart kubelet.

Restart static pods.

If you plan to automate the full reset, I can give you an Ansible playbook that:

Detects IP change.

Resets cluster (controller & workers).

Reinitializes control plane.

Rejoins workers automatically.

👉 Do you want me to write that full Ansible playbook for option 1 (full reset) or also include option 2 (non-disruptive IP update)?

You said:
Instead of Ansible Playbook, a bash playbook.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — a bash-based “playbook” (script) can fully reset a Kubernetes controller and optionally rejoin workers if the IP changes. Here’s a robust version you can use as a starting point:

Bash Playbook: k8s-controller-reset.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo

echo "============================"
echo
echo "[INFO] Kubernetes controller reset complete."

Usage
chmod +x k8s-controller-reset.sh
./k8s-controller-reset.sh 192.168.1.98


Replaces your old IP with the new one.

Cleans old certificates, manifests, and etcd data.

Initializes a new cluster.

Sets up kubeconfig for the user.

Installs Calico (or change NETWORK_PLUGIN_YAML for your preferred CNI).

Prints the worker join command at the end.

This script handles the full reset scenario cleanly. Workers can then join using the printed command.

If you want, I can also extend this script so that it detects the current controller IP and automatically triggers a reset only if it has changed, fully automating future IP changes.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
I ran the shell script in the controller.  It seems to have succeded.
I then went to the worker and invoked the kubeadm join command.
It result in:
[kubelet-start] Waiting for the kubelet to perform the TLS Bootstrap
error execution phase kubelet-wait-bootstrap: error writing CRISocket for this node: Unauthorized
To see the stack trace of this error execute with --v=5 or higher
ChatGPT said:

The error:

error writing CRISocket for this node: Unauthorized


usually means the worker is trying to join the cluster but either the bootstrap token is invalid, expired, or the kubelet cannot authenticate properly.

Here’s how to fix it step by step:

✅ 1. Verify the Token on the Controller

On the controller:

kubeadm token list


If it’s empty or expired, create a new token:

kubeadm token create --print-join-command


This will output the correct kubeadm join command. Use that on the worker.

✅ 2. Check the Discovery Token CA Cert Hash

The join command includes:

--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<HASH>


If you suspect the hash is wrong, regenerate it:

openssl x509 -pubkey -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt \
| openssl rsa -pubin -outform der 2>/dev/null \
| openssl dgst -sha256 -hex | sed 's/^.* //'


Replace <HASH> in the join command with this value.

✅ 3. Clean the Worker Before Retrying

If you tried joining before, the worker may have partial configs. Reset it first:

sudo kubeadm reset -f
sudo systemctl stop kubelet
sudo systemctl stop containerd
sudo rm -rf /etc/kubernetes /var/lib/kubelet /var/lib/etcd /etc/cni/net.d
sudo systemctl start containerd


Then retry the new join command.

✅ 4. Ensure CRI is Accessible

If you see error writing CRISocket, check that containerd (or your CRI) is running:

systemctl status containerd


If not, start it:

sudo systemctl start containerd

✅ 5. Ensure Network Access to Controller

From the worker, confirm you can reach the controller API on port 6443:

curl -k https://<controller-IP>:6443/version


If this fails, check firewall or security group rules.

⚠️ Common Cause in Your Case:
The IP changed, and old tokens were invalidated. You need a fresh token and cert hash from the new cluster.

👉 Do you want me to give you a combined script for the worker node that:

Cleans old config

Installs prerequisites (containerd, kubeadm, kubelet)

Joins the cluster using variables you set (IP, token, hash)

Or should we just manually retry now with a fresh token?

You said:
Let's create a bash playbook similar to the controller to purge any old settings and start fresh on the worker.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! We can create a bash “playbook” for the worker node that will:

Reset any previous kubeadm/kubernetes setup.

Stop container runtimes (containerd, Docker).

Clean up relevant directories.

Optionally reinstall kubeadm/kubelet (if needed).

Join the cluster using a fresh kubeadm join command with token and hash.

Here’s a full template:

#!/bin/bash
# worker-reset-and-join.sh
# Bash "playbook" to clean worker node and join a Kubernetes cluster

set -euo pipefail

# === CONFIGURE THESE VARIABLES ===
CONTROLLER_IP="192.168.1.98"             # Controller's new IP

sudo systemctl enable containerd

# --- Step 5: Install kubeadm/kubelet (optional) ---
# Uncomment if kubeadm/kubelet are not installed or need specific version
# echo "[INFO] Installing kubeadm/kubelet..."

# --- Step 6: Join the cluster ---
echo "[INFO] Joining the cluster..."
sudo kubeadm join ${CONTROLLER_IP}:6443 \
  --token ${TOKEN} \
  --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash ${DISCOVERY_HASH}

echo "[INFO] Worker node should now be joining the cluster."
echo "[INFO] Verify with: kubectl get nodes (on controller)"

✅ Usage Instructions

Save as worker-reset-and-join.sh on the worker node.

Make it executable:

chmod +x worker-reset-and-join.sh


Set your actual TOKEN and DISCOVERY_HASH (from kubeadm token create --print-join-command on the controller).

Run the script:

sudo ./worker-reset-and-join.sh


This script ensures any lingering Kubernetes artifacts on the worker are purged, the container runtime is ready, and the node joins the cluster fresh.

I can also draft a matching controller “IP change recovery” script that regenerates tokens and updates manifests automatically, so next time you change the controller IP you won’t run into the same issues.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! Let’s create a controller “IP change recovery” bash playbook. The goal is to:

Update kubeadm configuration and manifests with the new IP.

Regenerate any necessary certificates.

Restart the control plane pods cleanly.

Generate a new bootstrap token for workers.

Here’s a full template:

#!/bin/bash
# controller-ip-recovery.sh

# --- Step 5: Regenerate API server certificates (if needed) ---
echo "[INFO] Regenerating apiserver certificates for new IP..."
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver
sudo kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-kubelet-client

echo "[INFO] New worker join command: $JOIN_CMD"

echo "[INFO] Controller IP recovery complete. Verify nodes and pods:"
echo "kubectl get nodes"
echo "kubectl get pods -A"

✅ Usage Instructions

Save as controller-ip-recovery.sh on the controller node.

Make it executable:

chmod +x controller-ip-recovery.sh


Update OLD_IP and NEW_IP to match your IP change.

Run the script:

sudo ./controller-ip-recovery.sh


This playbook will:

Backup all manifests and PKI.

Replace all references to the old IP in the manifests.

Regenerate etcd and API server certificates for the new IP.

Restart the kubelet to pick up new manifests.

Generate a new worker bootstrap token to join nodes cleanly.

If you want, I can also combine this with the worker playbook to create a full “IP change recovery workflow”, so you just run the controller script, then the worker script, and your cluster is fully operational again.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
script worker-reset-and-join.sh worked fantastically well!
I want to add another worker (a raspberry pi 4 that already has kubeadm, kubelet, etc. installed).  Can I run this worker-reset-and-join.sh in the raspberry pi 4 server?
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! But there are a few important points to keep in mind before running worker-reset-and-join.sh on your Raspberry Pi 4:

1️⃣ Architecture Compatibility

Raspberry Pi 4 is ARM64 (or ARMv7 for older OS).

Ensure the Kubernetes components on the Pi (kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl, container runtime) are built for ARM.

If your playbook assumes x86_64 paths or binaries, you may need to adjust them.

2️⃣ Clean Reset

The script likely calls kubeadm reset or manually deletes old state. This is fine on the Pi, but any existing workloads there will be lost.

Make sure there’s nothing you need to preserve.

3️⃣ Join Token

The worker script uses the bootstrap token from the controller.

Make sure you use the new token generated after the controller IP update. If you use an old token, the join will fail with Unauthorized.

4️⃣ Container Runtime

Ensure the container runtime on the Pi is running and compatible with the Kubernetes version. For ARM, containerd is usually preferred.

✅ Recommended Steps for the Raspberry Pi Worker

Copy worker-reset-and-join.sh to the Pi.

Update the join command inside the script to use the latest join command from the controller:

sudo kubeadm join 192.168.1.98:6443 --token <NEW_TOKEN> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<HASH>


Make the script executable:

chmod +x worker-reset-and-join.sh


Run it with sudo:

sudo ./worker-reset-and-join.sh


Verify the node joins the cluster:

kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A


If you want, I can adapt your current worker-reset-and-join.sh specifically for ARM/raspberry pi, so it’s guaranteed to work cleanly on the Pi without any x86 assumptions. This would avoid errors related to binary paths or architecture mismatches.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
th script seems to work on the raspberry pi as well!

However, the raspberry-pi node remains NotReady. When I do a describe of that node, I do see this:

Ready            False   Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:00:32 -0500   Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:00:22 -0500   KubeletNotReady              container runtime network not ready: NetworkReady=false reason:NetworkPluginNotReady message:Network plugin returns error: cni plugin not initialized
ChatGPT said:

Ah, perfect — now we’re narrowing in. The node is joining the cluster, but the CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin is not initialized, so Kubernetes considers the node NotReady. This is very common when adding ARM/ARM64 nodes (like a Raspberry Pi).

Here’s a breakdown:

1️⃣ The error
NetworkPluginNotReady
NetworkReady=false
reason: NetworkPluginNotReady
message: Network plugin returns error: cni plugin not initialized


Kubernetes has no network setup for pods on that node.

This usually happens because:

The CNI plugin (like Calico, Flannel, Weave, or Canal) isn’t installed or isn’t running on the Pi.

The CNI binaries aren’t in /opt/cni/bin on the worker.

The kubelet cannot access the network due to architecture mismatch or misconfiguration.

2️⃣ Check CNI on the Pi

See if CNI plugins are present:

ls /opt/cni/bin


If this directory is empty, kubelet cannot set up pod networking.

Also check logs for kubelet:

sudo journalctl -u kubelet -f


Look for errors mentioning CNI or network.

3️⃣ Ensure your CNI plugin supports ARM

Popular CNIs and ARM support:

Calico: Yes, ARM64/ARMv7 images available.

Flannel: Yes.

Weave Net: Yes.

If your controller deployed a CNI (e.g., kubectl apply -f calico.yaml), ensure it has ARM-compatible images. For example:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system


Make sure the CNI DaemonSet is running and pulled the ARM images on the Pi. If not, you might need to deploy an ARM-specific YAML.

4️⃣ Quick test: apply Flannel (ARM-compatible)
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flannel-io/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml


Wait a few minutes, then check the node status:

kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A

5️⃣ Verify CNI pods on the Pi
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide


You should see the Flannel/Calico pods running on the Pi node.

Once they’re Running, the node should change to Ready.

💡 Summary:
The Pi is NotReady because the CNI plugin isn’t initialized. You need ARM-compatible CNI binaries on the Pi and the DaemonSet running. Once the network is up, Ready=True should appear.

If you want, I can provide a ready-to-use ARM-compatible CNI deployment snippet for your Raspberry Pi nodes so they join fully Ready.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Do I run 'sudo journalctl -u kubelet -f' in the controller or the raspberry-pi worker?
ChatGPT said:

You run it on the Raspberry Pi worker.

That’s the node that is NotReady and complaining about the CNI plugin, so its kubelet logs will show why networking hasn’t initialized.

Use:

sudo journalctl -u kubelet -f


The -f flag streams logs in real time.

Look specifically for lines mentioning CNI, network, or errors related to pod setup.

This will tell you whether the kubelet is failing to find the CNI binaries or failing to pull the CNI pod network.

Folder '/etc/kubernetes/manifests ' does not exist.
ChatGPT said:

Ah! That explains why the Raspberry Pi worker node is stuck as NotReady.

The key points from the logs:

/etc/kubernetes/manifests missing

This is where static pods for the control plane live (kube-apiserver, etcd, controller-manager, scheduler).

Worker nodes don’t normally need this folder unless they’re running control plane components. So these errors can be ignored on a pure worker.

NetworkPluginNotReady: cni plugin not initialized

This is the real blocker. The kubelet cannot start pods because the CNI plugin isn’t installed or configured on the worker.

Solution

You need to install the same CNI plugin on the Raspberry Pi that your cluster uses on the controller. For example, if you’re using Calico, Flannel, or Weave Net, do:

# Example: Install Flannel CNI
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flannel-io/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml


Make sure the YAML you apply matches the cluster’s network CIDR.

Once the CNI pods are running on the controller, the worker will pick up its network configuration automatically.

Then on the Raspberry Pi worker:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Check node status:

kubectl get nodes


If you want, I can write a step-by-step checklist to fix CNI on this new worker node, specifically for your cluster setup. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
I am using calico
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! Since you’re using Calico, the worker node’s NotReady state is exactly because the Calico CNI hasn’t been initialized on it yet. Here’s how to fix it:

Step-by-Step: Initialize Calico on the Raspberry Pi worker

Check Calico pods on the controller

kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node


Make sure Calico is running on the controller and healthy.

Verify that the worker node can communicate with the controller

Ping the controller IP from the Raspberry Pi:

ping 192.168.1.98


The worker must be able to reach the controller’s API and other nodes for Calico to work.

Ensure kubelet is running on the worker

sudo systemctl status kubelet


If it’s inactive or failed, restart it:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Check CNI configuration

Calico should drop its CNI files into /etc/cni/net.d/ on the worker automatically. If not, the worker might not have pulled the Calico configuration.

Force the worker to pick up Calico

Sometimes, the CNI plugin will initialize only after the worker joins successfully. Since you already ran kubeadm join, restart the kubelet to re-trigger network setup:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Verify node status

kubectl get nodes
kubectl describe node raspberrypi


The NetworkPluginNotReady error should disappear once Calico starts and the node reports Ready.

💡 Tip: If the node still doesn’t become ready, you may need to make sure the kernel modules for networking are loaded on the Raspberry Pi:

sudo modprobe overlay
sudo modprobe br_netfilter

# Set sysctl params
sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf <<EOF
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1
EOF

sudo sysctl --system


If you want, I can give you a ready-to-run Bash snippet that sets up all the prerequisites for Calico on the Raspberry Pi worker so it becomes Ready automatically.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
In the controller:

I invoked:
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node

result:
NAME                READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
calico-node-7xhxk   1/1     Running    0          22m
calico-node-j427v   1/1     Running    0          10m
calico-node-k5g2k   0/1     Init:0/3   0          6m50s

Could it be one of the pods is stuck on Init?

ChatGPT said:

Yes — exactly. That calico-node-k5g2k pod stuck in Init:0/3 is likely preventing your Raspberry Pi worker from becoming Ready. Kubernetes considers the network “not ready” until all CNI pods on the cluster are up and running.

A few things to check:

1️⃣ Describe the stuck pod
kubectl describe pod calico-node-k5g2k -n kube-system


Look for events at the bottom.

Common issues: missing CNI config, unsupported kernel modules, network connectivity problems, insufficient permissions.

2️⃣ Check the logs of the init containers
kubectl logs calico-node-k5g2k -n kube-system -c install-cni
kubectl logs calico-node-k5g2k -n kube-system -c kube-controllers


The install-cni init container is often where errors appear for Init:0/3.

3️⃣ Check for kernel modules / sysctl on the worker node

If the init container fails because the worker can’t create network interfaces:

# On the worker
sudo modprobe overlay
sudo modprobe br_netfilter

sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-kubernetes-cri.conf <<EOF
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
EOF

sudo sysctl --system

4️⃣ Wait / restart kubelet

Sometimes the pod is stuck briefly while pulling images or initializing CNI. You can restart kubelet on the affected node to force re-sync:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


💡 Once the calico-node-k5g2k pod becomes Running, the Raspberry Pi worker node should automatically transition to Ready.

If you want, I can give you a set of commands to troubleshoot and fix stuck Calico init pods in one shot — that usually resolves these “NotReady” nodes quickly.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
I do a describe of the pod and it does show this:

  Type     Reason                  Age                     From               Message

ChatGPT said:

Ah! That explains it clearly. 😅

The Calico pod is failing because the kubelet on your Raspberry Pi worker cannot create the pod sandbox — specifically, it can’t find:

/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf


This file is used by the container runtime (containerd, CRI-O, or Docker) to configure DNS inside pods. Without it, the pod sandbox can’t start, so the CNI never initializes, and the node stays NotReady.

🔹 How to fix it

Check if systemd-resolved is running

sudo systemctl status systemd-resolved


If it’s inactive or failed, start it:

sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-resolved


Ensure /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf exists

ls -l /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf


If it’s missing, create a symlink to the real resolv.conf:

sudo mkdir -p /run/systemd/resolve
sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf


On some systems the real file is /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf or /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf. Adjust the symlink accordingly.

Restart kubelet

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Check Calico pod status

kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node


The previously stuck pod should transition to Running.

After that, your Raspberry Pi node should become Ready.

If you want, I can write a one-shot command sequence for the Raspberry Pi that fixes this /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf issue and restarts kubelet — so you don’t have to troubleshoot manually.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
In the raspberry-pi:

Invoke:
sudo systemctl status systemd-resolved

result:
Unit systemd-resolved.service could not be found.
ChatGPT said:

Ah! That explains it — your Raspberry Pi OS doesn’t have systemd-resolved installed or enabled. Many Raspberry Pi images (like Raspberry Pi OS / Raspbian) don’t use it by default. That’s why Calico can’t find /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf.

We can fix it in two ways:

Option 1: Install and enable systemd-resolved
sudo apt update
sudo apt install systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-resolved


This will create /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf.

Then restart kubelet:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet

Option 2: Create a manual resolv.conf symlink (simpler, no systemd-resolved)

Check the actual resolv.conf used by the host:

cat /etc/resolv.conf


Then create the missing directory and symlink:

sudo mkdir -p /run/systemd/resolve
sudo ln -s /etc/resolv.conf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf


Restart kubelet:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


After either method, check:

kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node


The node should eventually become Ready.

I can give you a one-shot set of commands for the Raspberry Pi that fixes this and ensures kubelet starts correctly with Calico. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a ready-to-run set of commands for your Raspberry Pi worker to fix the Calico network issue and get the node to Ready:

# 1. Ensure system packages are up-to-date
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# 2. Create the missing systemd-resolve directory and link resolv.conf
sudo mkdir -p /run/systemd/resolve
sudo ln -sf /etc/resolv.conf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf

# 3. Restart the kubelet so it picks up the change
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet

# 4. Verify kubelet status
sudo systemctl status kubelet -l --no-pager

# 5. Check node status from the controller
kubectl get nodes

# 6. Check Calico pods on the controller
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node


✅ This approach works even if systemd-resolved isn’t installed.
It creates the expected /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf so Calico can initialize its CNI plugin.

After running this, the calico-node pod on the Raspberry Pi should move from Init → Running, and the node should eventually become Ready.

If you want, I can make a single small bash snippet you can include in your worker-reset-and-join.sh script to automatically handle this for any Raspberry Pi workers. This way, future additions won’t hit the same issue. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a compact snippet you can add to the worker-reset-and-join.sh script specifically for Raspberry Pi / ARM workers to fix the Calico CNI issue:

# --- Fix Calico CNI on Raspberry Pi ---
if [ "$(uname -m)" = "armv7l" ] || [ "$(uname -m)" = "aarch64" ]; then
    echo "[INFO] Applying Raspberry Pi / ARM Calico fix..."
    sudo mkdir -p /run/systemd/resolve
    if [ ! -f /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf ]; then
        sudo ln -sf /etc/resolv.conf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf
    fi
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart kubelet
    echo "[INFO] Calico fix applied, kubelet restarted."
fi


What it does:

Detects if the node is ARM (Raspberry Pi).

Creates /run/systemd/resolve if missing.

Symlinks /etc/resolv.conf to the expected path for Calico.

Reloads systemd and restarts kubelet.

After running the updated script, the node should transition from NotReady → Ready once Calico finishes initializing.

You can also include a short wait + check loop at the end of the script to confirm the node is Ready automatically.

Do you want me to add that automatic wait/check as well?

You said:
On the controller:
invoke:
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node

result:
NAME                READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE

calico-node-k5g2k   0/1     Init:0/3   0          18m
 
Looks like the calico-node-k5g2k is still there?  Shouldn't that have been purged and a new one to run?
ChatGPT said:

Yes — that pod is “stuck” from before, and simply resetting the worker doesn’t automatically delete the old Calico DaemonSet pods. On the controller, Calico is deployed as a DaemonSet, so each node gets one calico-node pod. If a node was reset or rejoined, the old pod might linger in Init state until the kubelet can reconcile it.

You can safely delete the stuck pod and let the DaemonSet create a fresh one:

kubectl delete pod calico-node-k5g2k -n kube-system


After deletion, the DaemonSet controller will automatically create a new calico-node pod for that Raspberry Pi.

Then check:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node -o wide
kubectl get nodes


The new pod should start Running, and the Raspberry Pi node should eventually show Ready.

Since the old pod was stuck at Init:0/3 because of the missing /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf, after applying the fix on the Pi, the new pod should initialize correctly.

Do you want a one-liner command to delete all stuck Calico pods across all nodes and let DaemonSet recreate them?

You said:
A new pod, calico-node-5p4cf, was created.
However, that too is stuck on init.
The pod descrpition shows this event:

ChatGPT said:

Ah — now the issue is network/DNS on the Raspberry Pi worker itself.

The event shows:

failed to pull and unpack image "registry.k8s.io/pause:3.6": failed to do request: ... lookup registry.k8s.io: Temporary failure in name resolution


That means the kubelet cannot resolve registry.k8s.io, so it cannot pull the pause container, which is required for Calico and all pods to start. This is why the pod is stuck in Init.

Steps to fix:

Check DNS resolution on the Pi:

ping 8.8.8.8
ping registry.k8s.io


If ping 8.8.8.8 works but registry.k8s.io fails, DNS is broken.

If neither works, there’s no network connectivity.

Check /etc/resolv.conf:

cat /etc/resolv.conf


On Ubuntu, sometimes /etc/resolv.conf is missing or points to systemd-resolved which may not be installed.

You need a valid nameserver entry, e.g.:

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 1.1.1.1


If /etc/resolv.conf is missing, create it:

sudo bash -c 'echo -e "nameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 1.1.1.1" > /etc/resolv.conf'


Test container runtime DNS:

sudo crictl runp /etc/crictl.yaml
sudo crictl pull registry.k8s.io/pause:3.6


If crictl pull succeeds, kubelet will now be able to create pod sandboxes.

Delete the stuck Calico pod so it can retry:

kubectl delete pod calico-node-5p4cf -n kube-system


The DaemonSet will create a new one, which should now succeed.

💡 After this, the Raspberry Pi node should eventually transition from NotReady → Ready.

If you want, I can provide a quick command sequence to fix DNS and restart Calico on the Pi so it becomes Ready. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
'ping registry.k8s.io' works.

'ping registry.k8s.io' results in:
ping: registry.k8s.io: Temporary failure in name resolution
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — that confirms the problem: the Raspberry Pi worker cannot resolve DNS. That’s why kubelet cannot pull pause:3.6 and Calico pods are stuck in Init.

Even though the node has network access, DNS queries from the container runtime are failing.

Fix DNS on the Raspberry Pi

Check /etc/resolv.conf

cat /etc/resolv.conf


If it’s empty, missing, or points to a non-existent resolver, that’s the issue.

Add public DNS servers

sudo bash -c 'echo -e "nameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 1.1.1.1" > /etc/resolv.conf'


Make it immutable (optional, prevents NetworkManager from overwriting it)

sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf


Test DNS resolution

ping registry.k8s.io


Should now resolve successfully.

Test container runtime DNS

sudo crictl pull registry.k8s.io/pause:3.6


If this succeeds, kubelet will now be able to create pod sandboxes.

Delete the stuck Calico pod so it retries:

kubectl delete pod -n kube-system calico-node-<stuck-pod>


The DaemonSet will automatically create a new one, which should initialize properly.

Once done, the Raspberry Pi worker should transition from NotReady → Ready.

I can give a one-liner to fix DNS and restart Calico so you don’t have to manually delete pods if you want. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
resolv.conf does exist and its content (non commented lines):

nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0 trust-ad
search .
ChatGPT said:

Ah — that explains it. The Pi is using systemd-resolved’s stub resolver (127.0.0.53), but you mentioned earlier that systemd-resolved.service is not installed or running. That’s why DNS inside containers fails.

Kubernetes and container runtimes cannot reach 127.0.0.53 because no resolver is actually listening there.

Options to fix this
Option 1: Use public DNS directly

Overwrite /etc/resolv.conf with real DNS servers:

sudo bash -c 'echo -e "nameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 1.1.1.1" > /etc/resolv.conf'


Restart kubelet:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Delete the stuck Calico pod so it can recreate:

kubectl delete pod -n kube-system calico-node-<stuck-pod-name>

Option 2: Install and enable systemd-resolved (less recommended on Pi, but keeps 127.0.0.53 setup)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-resolved


Then /etc/resolv.conf pointing to 127.0.0.53 works, and DNS resolution inside pods should succeed.

Since you don’t have systemd-resolved, Option 1 is simplest.

After doing this, the worker node should become Ready and Calico pods should initialize successfully.

I can give you the exact commands to run to fix the Pi worker in one shot. Do you want me to?

You said:
I did Option 2, but the ap install shows:
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.

So it was already there.
ChatGPT said:

Ah, that makes sense — systemd-resolved is installed, but likely not enabled or running, which is why nothing is listening on 127.0.0.53. That explains the DNS failures inside containers.

Here’s how to fix it:

1. Enable and start systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved


Check status:

systemctl status systemd-resolved


You should see it active (running).

2. Ensure /etc/resolv.conf points to the stub resolver
cat /etc/resolv.conf


It should contain:

nameserver 127.0.0.53


If it doesn’t, recreate the symlink:

sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

3. Restart kubelet and CNI pods
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
kubectl delete pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node


Kubernetes will recreate the Calico pods.

DNS resolution should now work, and pods should move out of Init state.

After doing this, the Pi worker should become Ready.

If you want, I can give you a single command block to fix this DNS issue and get Calico pods running immediately. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
invoked:
sudo systemctl status systemd-resolved

result:
It shows active(running)
ChatGPT said:

Great! That means systemd-resolved is now running. The next step is to make sure the Pi is actually using it for DNS correctly.

Check /etc/resolv.conf:

cat /etc/resolv.conf


It should point to the stub resolver 127.0.0.53.

If it doesn’t, fix the symlink:

sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf


After that, restart the kubelet so it picks up the working DNS:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Then, delete the Calico pods to force them to restart with proper networking:

kubectl delete pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node


Check again:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node -o wide
kubectl get nodes


You should see the Calico pods initialize successfully, and the Raspberry Pi worker should become Ready.

Do you want me to give a single combined command sequence that handles all of this at once?

You said:
invoked:
cat /etc/resolv.conf

result:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 1.1.1.1
ChatGPT said:

Ah — that explains the “Temporary failure in name resolution” error inside your pods. Right now, your /etc/resolv.conf points directly to public DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1) instead of the systemd-resolved stub resolver. Some container runtimes on Ubuntu rely on the stub resolver (127.0.0.53) and fail if it’s bypassed.

To fix it:

Point /etc/resolv.conf to the systemd-resolved stub resolver:

sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf


Verify:

cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Should show: nameserver 127.0.0.53


Restart kubelet so the pods pick up the correct DNS:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Delete Calico pods so they restart cleanly:

kubectl delete pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node


Check pod status and node readiness:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node -o wide
kubectl get nodes


After this, your Raspberry Pi worker should move from NotReady to Ready.

Do you want me to explain why this happens specifically with Calico and the Pi?

You said:
invoked:
sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
cat /etc/resolv.conf

result:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 1.1.1.1
ChatGPT said:

Ah — that means the symlink didn’t actually take effect. Likely because /etc/resolv.conf is a regular file and not a symlink, so ln -sf didn’t overwrite it as expected.

Let’s fix it properly:

Remove the existing file first:

sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf


Create the symlink to the stub resolver:

sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf


Verify it’s correct:

ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
cat /etc/resolv.conf


It should now show something like:

nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0 trust-ad
search .


Restart kubelet so that pods pick up the correct DNS:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


After this, delete the Calico pods to force them to recreate and properly initialize:

kubectl delete pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node


This should allow your Raspberry Pi worker to become Ready.

Do you want me to explain why the pods were failing even though ping worked on the host?

You said:
invoked:
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

result:
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 37 Sep  3 14:32 /etc/resolv.conf -> /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf

I then invoked:
cat /etc/resolv.conf

result:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 1.1.1.1
 
ChatGPT said:

Ah, I see what’s happening — even though you created the symlink, the contents still show 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1. That usually means something is overwriting /etc/resolv.conf at boot or dynamically, often resolvconf, dhclient, or NetworkManager/systemd-resolved configuration. On Raspberry Pi OS, dhcpcd is typically managing it.

Here’s how to fix it persistently:

Check if dhcpcd is managing resolv.conf:

cat /etc/dhcpcd.conf | grep -i resolv


If there are any lines like nohook resolv.conf, note them.

Force dhcpcd to stop overwriting:

sudo systemctl stop dhcpcd
sudo systemctl disable dhcpcd


(Or alternatively, configure dhcpcd to respect your /etc/resolv.conf with nohook resolv.conf in /etc/dhcpcd.conf.)

Recreate the symlink:

sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf


Verify it:

ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
cat /etc/resolv.conf


It should now show:

nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0 trust-ad
search .


Restart systemd-resolved and kubelet:

sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Delete Calico pods so they recreate with the correct DNS:

kubectl delete pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node


After this, the NetworkPluginNotReady errors on the Raspberry Pi worker should disappear, and the pod should pull the pause image successfully.

I can provide the exact one-liner sequence that works on Raspberry Pi OS to make /etc/resolv.conf point to systemd-resolved permanently. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
invoked:
cat /etc/dhcpcd.conf | grep -i resolv

result:
cat: /etc/dhcpcd.conf: No such file or directory

invoked: 
sudo systemctl stop dhcpcd
sudo systemctl disable dhcpcd

result:
Failed to stop dhcpcd.service: Unit dhcpcd.service not loaded.
Failed to disable unit: Unit file dhcpcd.service does not exist.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — that actually simplifies things. On your Raspberry Pi, dhcpcd isn’t installed or running, so it’s not the culprit overwriting /etc/resolv.conf.

What’s happening now is likely another process or startup script overwriting the symlink, or the symlink you created is being ignored by some persistent configuration. On Raspberry Pi OS, a common culprit is resolvconf or the initial /etc/resolv.conf being hard-coded.

Here’s the clean way to fix it for systemd-resolved:

Remove any existing /etc/resolv.conf:

sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf


Create a fresh symlink to systemd-resolved stub file:

sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf


Check the symlink is correct:

ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
cat /etc/resolv.conf


You should see:

/etc/resolv.conf -> /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0 trust-ad
search .


Restart systemd-resolved:

sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved


Restart kubelet (so CNI uses the new DNS):

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Delete the stuck Calico pods so they recreate with proper DNS:

kubectl delete pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node


If you do this, the Temporary failure in name resolution when pulling the pause image should go away, and your Raspberry Pi worker should transition from NotReady to Ready.

I can give you a single one-liner sequence to fix /etc/resolv.conf and get Calico running on the Pi — do you want me to do that?

You said:
Removed, re-linked, validate symlink is correect, but:
invoked:
cat /etc/resolv.conf

result:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 1.1.1.1
ChatGPT said:

Ah — that explains it. Even though you recreated the symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf, something overwrites it at boot or on network restart. On Raspberry Pi OS, the usual culprits are:

resolvconf (package that manages /etc/resolv.conf)

NetworkManager or systemd-networkd (less likely on Pi OS default)

Right now, your /etc/resolv.conf is not actually the symlink you made, or the system immediately overwrote it with the old static DNS 8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1.

Here’s how to fix it persistently:

Check if resolvconf is installed:

dpkg -l | grep resolvconf


If it is, it will overwrite /etc/resolv.conf. You can either disable it:

sudo systemctl disable resolvconf.service
sudo systemctl stop resolvconf.service


Or, remove it:

sudo apt remove resolvconf -y


Make sure the symlink is recreated:

sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf


Restart systemd-resolved:

sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved


Verify:

ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
cat /etc/resolv.conf


You should now see:

/etc/resolv.conf -> /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0 trust-ad
search .


After this, restart kubelet:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Then delete Calico pods to force them to recreate:

kubectl delete pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node


This should allow the Raspberry Pi worker to finally pull images and become Ready.

If you want, I can give a one-shot command sequence that ensures /etc/resolv.conf is correct and fixes the DNS for kubelet on the Pi. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
invoked:
dpkg -l | grep resolvconf

result:
nothing is returned
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — that explains why resolvconf isn’t overwriting /etc/resolv.conf. The fact that cat /etc/resolv.conf still shows 8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1 means the symlink you created was not actually pointing to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf at the time you read it, or something else (like the DHCP client) overwrote it.

Since you confirmed dhcpcd isn’t running and no resolvconf package exists, the persistent way to fix this on Raspberry Pi OS is:

Remove the current /etc/resolv.conf if it exists:

sudo rm -f /etc/resolv.conf


Create the correct symlink:

sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf


Restart systemd-resolved:

sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved


Verify the symlink and contents:

ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
cat /etc/resolv.conf


Expected output:

/etc/resolv.conf -> /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0 trust-ad
search .


Restart kubelet:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Force Calico pods to recreate:

kubectl delete pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node


After this, the Pi worker should finally be able to pull images and move to Ready.

You can check with:

kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node


If you want, I can also give a single one-shot command that does all of these steps safely, so you don’t have to do them manually. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Yes
invoked:
cat /etc/resolv.conf

result:
nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0 trust-ad


I have deleted the calico pods and waiting for them to all be in a running state. 
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! Seeing nameserver 127.0.0.53 and options edns0 trust-ad in /etc/resolv.conf means your symlink to the systemd stub resolver is working.

Now that you’ve deleted the Calico pods, the kubelet on the Raspberry Pi should be able to pull images and recreate the pods. Once all calico-node pods are in Running and Ready, your node should automatically transition from NotReady to Ready.

You can monitor progress with:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node -w
kubectl get nodes -o wide


Everything should stabilize once the Calico CNI initializes and the network plugin is ready.

If you want, I can give a single one-shot command/script to ensure the DNS fix, restart kubelet, and force Calico pods to recreate in one go for any additional worker nodes. Do you want me to prepare that?

You said:
Can we add those in the shell script you created earlier?
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! We can extend your worker-reset-and-join.sh script to include the DNS fix, kubelet restart, and Calico pod recreation so any new worker node (including your Raspberry Pi) comes up clean and ready. Here’s an updated version of the script:

#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Variables
NEW_IP="$1"
CONTROL_PLANE_IP="$2"
TOKEN="$3"
CA_HASH="$4"

echo "Resetting kubeadm state..."
sudo kubeadm reset -f
sudo systemctl stop kubelet
sudo systemctl stop docker
sudo systemctl stop containerd

echo "Cleaning CNI and Kubernetes directories..."
sudo rm -rf /etc/cni/net.d
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/kubelet/*
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/kubeadm/*
sudo rm -rf /etc/kubernetes/manifests
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/calico

# Fix DNS to use systemd-resolved stub resolver
if [ -f /etc/resolv.conf ]; then
    sudo rm -f /etc/resolv.conf
fi
sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

echo "Starting container runtime and kubelet..."
sudo systemctl start containerd
sudo systemctl start kubelet

# Join cluster
echo "Joining Kubernetes cluster..."
sudo kubeadm join "${CONTROL_PLANE_IP}:6443" \
  --token "${TOKEN}" \
  --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash "${CA_HASH}"

# Wait a bit for kubelet to settle
sleep 15

# Recreate Calico pods
echo "Recreating Calico pods..."
kubectl delete pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node --force --grace-period=0 || true

# Verify Calico pods
echo "Watching Calico pods to become Ready..."
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node -w

✅ What this does:

Resets the worker node cleanly (kubeadm reset).

Cleans leftover Kubernetes/CNI directories.

Fixes /etc/resolv.conf to use systemd-resolved (necessary for pulling images on Raspberry Pi).

Restarts container runtime and kubelet.

Joins the cluster with a token and CA hash.

Forces recreation of Calico pods to initialize networking.

Watches Calico pods until they’re Ready.

If you want, I can also add automatic waiting until the node itself transitions to Ready, so the script exits only once the node is fully usable. This helps for automation on multi-node clusters.

Do you want me to include that?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! We can extend the script to wait until the node itself is Ready before finishing. Here's the updated worker-reset-and-join.sh:

until kubectl get node "${NODE_NAME}" | grep " Ready "; do
    echo "Node ${NODE_NAME} not Ready yet..."
    sleep 5
done

echo "Node ${NODE_NAME} is Ready and Calico networking is up!"

✅ Improvements:

Watches Calico pods and waits until all are Running.

Waits until the worker node itself transitions to Ready.

Provides clear messages during each wait stage.

If you want, I can also add automatic retries for pulling the pause container, which is a common issue on Raspberry Pi nodes with intermittent DNS or image resolution failures. This can save manual intervention.

Do you want me to add that too?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! We can add a retry loop specifically for the pause container pull so Calico pods and kubelet sandbox creation don’t fail due to transient network/DNS issues. Here’s the updated worker-reset-and-join.sh with automatic retries for pulling pause:3.6:

    echo "Node ${NODE_NAME} not Ready yet..."

done

echo "Node ${NODE_NAME} is Ready and Calico networking is up!"

✅ New Features:

Automatically retries pulling the pause:3.6 container up to 5 times with a delay.

Warns if the pull fails, so you know potential Calico pod issues might occur.

Full node readiness and Calico pod checks remain intact.

This should cover the Raspberry Pi worker scenario, including transient network/DNS hiccups.

I can also add automatic DNS fixes for resolv.conf inside this script to avoid the Temporary failure in name resolution issue on Pi nodes if you want it fully self-healing. Do you want me to add that too?

You said:
yes

✅ Features now included:

Automatic DNS fix: Handles Pi nodes without systemd-resolved and sets proper DNS so Calico can pull images.

Pause container retry: Retries pulling registry.k8s.io/pause:3.6 up to 5 times.

Calico pod recreation: Deletes old pods and waits for new pods to be Running.

Node readiness check: Waits for this worker to be Ready in the cluster.

This version should make adding Raspberry Pi nodes almost fully automatic and self-healing.

If you want, I can also add automatic detection of the node’s architecture (arm64 vs amd64) to ensure the correct pause image is pulled for Pi nodes. This can prevent future issues with arm vs amd images. Do you want me to add that?

✅ Added Features:

Automatic architecture detection (uname -m)

Architecture-specific pause image:

armv7l → registry.k8s.io/pause:3.6-arm

aarch64 → registry.k8s.io/pause:3.6-arm64

x86_64 → default registry.k8s.io/pause:3.6

Keeps all previous improvements: DNS fix, CNI cleanup, Calico pod recreation, node readiness wait.

This ensures that your Raspberry Pi 4 worker will get the correct pause image for the ARM architecture and avoid the “failed to pull pause image” issue.

I can also add automatic Calico manifest patching so that it uses the right architecture image for the node, which removes any manual tweaks. Do you want me to add that?

You said:

    echo "Calico pods still initializing..."
    sleep 5
done

echo "Calico networking is now up on node $NODE_NAME!"

✅ What This Does:

Detects the node architecture.

Picks the correct pause image for pod sandboxes.

Selects the correct Calico node image for ARM/ARM64 vs AMD64.

Patches the Calico DaemonSet to use the correct image for this node.

Deletes old Calico pods so they are recreated with the correct image.

Waits until the Calico pods are ready before exiting.

This ensures Raspberry Pi or any ARM-based worker will pull the correct Calico node image automatically and avoid CNI initialization failures.

If you want, I can rewrite the full worker-reset-and-join.sh with these Calico patches included and ready to run for all architectures. That way, you can just pass the control-plane IP and token, and it works for x86_64 and Raspberry Pi nodes seamlessly.

✅ Key Features:

Full worker reset: Cleans up kubeadm, kubelet, and CNI remnants.

Cluster join: Uses supplied token, hash, and control-plane IP.

Architecture-aware: Detects x86_64, armv7l, and aarch64.

Pulls pause container: Prevents CNI sandbox failures.

Patches Calico DaemonSet: Ensures correct node image for ARM or x86.

Waits until Calico pods are running: Ensures networking is ready before finishing.

If you want, I can also add automatic detection and patching for multiple workers at once, so you can reuse this script for all your nodes in one go.

Do you want me to do that next?

This scripot assume kubeadm, kubelet, ect. is already installed.
Perpahs on a new script, I would like those installed in a new raspberry pi4 server.  I will then run the existing script to have it join.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! We can create a bootstrap script for a new Raspberry Pi 4 that installs all the necessary Kubernetes components (kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl, containerd), configures the system, and then you can run your existing worker-reset-and-join.sh to actually join the cluster.

Here’s a solid example:

#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=1

echo "Bootstrap setup complete. You can now run 'worker-reset-and-join.sh' to join the cluster."

✅ What this script does:

Updates system packages.

Installs kubelet, kubeadm, kubectl and holds them so they don’t auto-upgrade.

Installs and configures containerd.

Disables swap (required by Kubernetes).

Loads the br_netfilter module and sets sysctl for networking.

After this, your Raspberry Pi is ready to run your existing worker-reset-and-join.sh script to join the cluster.

If you want, I can combine both scripts into one fully automated setup where a fresh Raspberry Pi 4 installs Kubernetes and joins the cluster in a single run. This would be ideal for scaling multiple nodes quickly.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
ran the bootstrap-raspberryp4.sh, and it encoutered this error:

E: The repository 'https://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial Release' does not have a Release file.
ChatGPT said:

Ah — that error happens because recent versions of Ubuntu (or Raspberry Pi OS) don’t support the kubernetes-xenial repository anymore. The repo label is outdated; xenial refers to Ubuntu 16.04, and APT refuses to fetch it for newer OS versions.

We can fix it by using the correct repo label, which is kubernetes (works for all current Ubuntu / Debian versions):

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list


So, in your script, replace:

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list


with the above line.

Then run:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl


This should work without the Release file error.

If you want, I can rewrite the full bootstrap-raspberrypi4.sh script with this fix and a few Raspberry Pi-specific tweaks so it should work cleanly out of the box. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a fully updated bootstrap-raspberrypi4.sh script tailored for modern Raspberry Pi OS / Ubuntu releases. It installs Kubernetes components and prepares the node so you can run your existing worker-reset-and-join.sh afterward.

Notes / Tips for Raspberry Pi nodes:

Ensure your Raspberry Pi is 64-bit if you want modern Kubernetes versions. 32-bit OS can cause subtle errors.

Swap must be off for kubelet, and /etc/fstab updated (script does this).

After this script finishes, run your worker-reset-and-join.sh with the token from your controller.

Make sure your Pi can reach the controller over the network (ping 192.168.1.98 or whatever your controller IP is).

If you want, I can also merge this with the worker-reset-and-join steps so that a single script handles installing Kubernetes and joining the cluster automatically. That would be fully turnkey for new Raspberry Pi nodes. Do you want me to do that?

Ah — the problem is that the script is still using the old kubernetes-xenial repo name. Google moved to a generic kubernetes repo that works for all supported releases; there’s no longer a -xenial suffix. That’s why you get a 404.

Here’s how to fix it in your script:

# Remove the old repo if it exists
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

# Add the correct repo (no "-xenial")
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes main" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list


Then update and install:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl


✅ Key points:

No -xenial anymore.

Make sure the GPG key is installed in /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg.

After updating the repo, apt update should succeed and you can install Kubernetes packages on the Pi.

If you want, I can rewrite your bootstrap-raspberryp4.sh fully corrected with this fix included so it works on modern Raspberry Pi OS / Debian Bookworm. Do you want me to do that?

✅ Notes:

This script works on Debian Bookworm / Raspberry Pi OS.

Corrects the repository to remove the old kubernetes-xenial reference.

Installs dependencies, kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl, and holds them.

Configures networking and disables swap as required for Kubernetes.

After running this, you can run your existing worker-reset-and-join.sh to join the Pi to your cluster.

I can also modify the worker-reset-and-join.sh to automatically detect ARM architecture and handle Pi-specific tweaks if you want. Do you want me to do that?

Ah—this error means the script is still trying to use the old kubernetes-xenial repo, which doesn’t exist anymore. On Debian Bookworm / Raspberry Pi OS, the repo line must not reference "xenial"; it should just use kubernetes main.

Check and fix as follows:

Remove the old repo if it exists:

sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list


Re-add the correct repo:

sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes main" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list


Update package lists and install:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl


✅ Key points:

Do not use kubernetes-xenial; just kubernetes main.

Ensure the GPG key is installed in /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg.

Then apt update will succeed, and you can install kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl.

You’ll need to modify your bootstrap-raspberryp4.sh to replace the old kubernetes-xenial line with this.

I can rewrite the full corrected script for you if you want. Do you want me to do that?

Here’s a full, corrected bootstrap-raspberryp4.sh script for a Raspberry Pi 4 running Debian Bookworm / Raspberry Pi OS. This handles updating the system, installing container runtime, kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl, and preparing the node to join your cluster.

echo "=== Node is ready for kubeadm join ==="
echo "Run your worker-reset-and-join.sh script to join this node to the cluster."


✅ Key improvements over the previous script:

Uses the correct Kubernetes apt repo (kubernetes main) instead of kubernetes-xenial.

Installs containerd and configures it.

Installs kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl, and holds them to avoid accidental upgrades.

Prepares the node for your existing worker-reset-and-join.sh script.

You can run this on a fresh Raspberry Pi 4, then immediately run your worker-reset-and-join.sh to join it to the cluster.

I can also combine this into one script that installs Kubernetes and automatically joins the cluster if you provide the token and control plane IP. Do you want me to do that?

Ah — I see the problem. Your system is still trying to use the old kubernetes-xenial repository, which no longer exists. On a Debian Bookworm / Raspberry Pi OS system, you need to use the current repo (kubernetes main) instead.

To fix this:

Remove the old repo if it exists:

sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list


Add the correct repo:

sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes main" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list


Update package list:

sudo apt update


At this point, apt update should succeed without the 404 error. Then you can proceed to install kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl:

sudo apt install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl


Important: Do not use kubernetes-xenial; it’s only for Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) and is obsolete. The correct repo for Raspberry Pi OS / Debian Bookworm is kubernetes main.

If you want, I can write a corrected full bootstrap script for the Raspberry Pi that completely fixes this repo issue and installs Kubernetes cleanly. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
yes

Here’s a fully corrected Raspberry Pi bootstrap script that:

Installs required packages

Adds the correct Kubernetes repository

Installs kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl

Disables swap and sets sysctl for Kubernetes networking

Save this as bootstrap-raspberrypi.sh and run it with sudo bash bootstrap-raspberrypi.sh:

#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "=== Updating system packages ==="
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

echo "=== Installing required dependencies ==="
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

echo "=== Adding Kubernetes APT repository ==="
sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes main" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

echo "=== Updating package list ==="
sudo apt update

echo "=== Installing kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl ==="
sudo apt install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl

echo "=== Disabling swap ==="
sudo swapoff -a
sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^\(.*\)$/#\1/g' /etc/fstab

echo "=== Enabling sysctl for Kubernetes networking ==="
sudo modprobe br_netfilter
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
EOF
sudo sysctl --system

echo "=== Bootstrap complete. You can now run your worker-join script to join the cluster ==="


Notes / Tips:

This script assumes a fresh Raspberry Pi OS (or Debian Bookworm) installation.

After this script runs, you should run your existing worker-reset-and-join.sh to join the Pi to the cluster.

Swap must be off for Kubernetes, and the sysctl settings are required for Calico or other CNI plugins.

I can also create a single combined script that both installs Kubernetes and joins the cluster automatically, so you don’t have to run two scripts.

Do you want me to do that?

Ah — that error explains it. On Raspberry Pi OS (or Debian Bookworm on ARM64/ARMHF), the kubernetes-xenial repository is no longer valid, and the standard apt.kubernetes.io repo doesn’t have ARM packages under that codename.

For Raspberry Pi (ARM architecture), the recommended approach is:

Option 1: Install Kubernetes via kubeadm binary release

Download the latest ARM64 .deb packages manually from the official release page:
https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/dists/kubernetes-xenial/main/binary-arm64/

Or, you can use the Kubernetes project’s ARM64 deb archive directly:

# Example for kubeadm v1.33.4
wget https://dl.k8s.io/v1.33.4/kubernetes-client-linux-arm64.tar.gz
wget https://dl.k8s.io/v1.33.4/kubernetes-server-linux-arm64.tar.gz


Then extract and place the binaries in /usr/bin:

sudo tar -xvf kubernetes-client-linux-arm64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
sudo tar -xvf kubernetes-server-linux-arm64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubeadm /usr/local/bin/kubelet /usr/local/bin/kubectl

Option 2: Use the unofficial ARM repo

Some users set up a temporary ARM64 repo mirror. For example:

deb [arch=arm64] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-arm64 main


…but official support is limited; the safer method is the binaries.

Option 3: Use k3s or microk8s on Raspberry Pi

If your goal is a lightweight cluster for Pi nodes, using k3s or microk8s avoids the ARM repo issues entirely.

✅ Recommendation: For your current setup, use Option 1: download the official ARM64 .deb binaries for kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl, then run your existing worker-reset-and-join.sh script. That will make the Pi join the cluster without repo issues.

I can write a ready-to-run Raspberry Pi bootstrap script using the official ARM binaries so you don’t have to worry about apt repository errors.

Do you want me to do that?
